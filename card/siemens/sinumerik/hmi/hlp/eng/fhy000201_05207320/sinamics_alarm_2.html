<td>- check the DRIVE-CLiQ wiring.<br />
- reduce the number of components on the DRIVE-CLiQ line involved and distribute these to other DRIVE-CLiQ sockets of the Control Unit. This means that communication is uniformly distributed over several lines.<br />
For fault value = 1yy - 4yy in addition:<br />
- increase the sampling times (p0112, p0115, p4099). If necessary, for DCC or FBLOCKS, change the assignment of the runtime group (p21000, p20000) so that the sampling time (r21001, r20001) is increased.<br />
- if necessary, reduce the number of cyclically calculated blocks (DCC) and&#47;or function blocks (FBLOCKS).<br />
- reduce the function modules (r0108).<br />
- establish the conditions for operation with a current controller sampling time of 31.25 &micro;s (at the DRIVE-CLiQ line, only operate Motor Modules and Sensor Modules with this sampling time and only use a permitted Sensor Module (e.g. SMC20, this means a 3 at the last position of the Article No.)).<br />
- For an NX, the corresponding Sensor Module for a possibly existing second measuring system should be connected to a free DRIVE-CLiQ socket of the NX.<br />
- for BSR Motor Modules, the following applies: If Safety Extended Functions is enabled, and 6 axes are operated on the DRIVE-CLiQ line, then the clock cycle for the actual value sensing must be set as follows: p9511 &gt;= 8 * current controller sampling time (p0115[0]).<br />
For fault value = 8yy in addition:<br />
- check the clock cycles settings (p0112, p0115, p4099). Clock cycles on a DRIVE-CLiQ line must be perfect integer multiples of one another. As clock cycle on a line, all clock cycles of all drive objects in the previously mentioned parameters apply, which have components on the line involved.<br />
For fault value = 9yy in addition:<br />
- check the clock cycles settings (p0112, p0115, p4099). The lower the numerical value difference between two clock cycles, the higher the lowest common multiple. This behavior has a significantly stronger influence, the higher the numerical values of the clock cycles.<br />

<td>One of the following counter-measures can be selected if no faults have occurred in the topology detection itself:<br />
If commissioning is still not completed:<br />
- carry out a self-commissioning routine (starting from p0009 = 1).<br />
In general:<br />
Set p0099 = r0098, set p0009 = 0; for existing Motor Modules, this results in servo drives being automatically generated (p0107).<br />
Generating servo drives: Set p0097 to 1, set p0009 to 0.<br />
Generating vector drives: Set p0097 to 2, set p0009 to 0.<br />
Generating vector drives with parallel connection: set p0097 to 12, set p0009 to 0.<br />
In order to set configurations in p0108, before setting p0009 to 0, it is possible to first set p0009 to 2 and modify p0108. The index corresponds to the drive object (p0107).<br />
If commissioning has already been completed:<br />
- re-establish the original connections and re-connect power to the Control Unit.<br />
- restore the factory setting for the complete equipment (all of the drives) and allow automatic self-commissioning again.<br />
- change the device parameterization to match the connections (this is only possible using the commissioning tool).<br />
Notice:<br />
Topology changes that result in this fault being generated cannot be accepted by the automatic function in the device, but must be transferred using the commissioning tool and parameter download. The automatic function in the device only allows constant topology to be used. Otherwise, when the topology is changed, all of the previous parameter settings are lost and replaced by the factory setting.<br />
