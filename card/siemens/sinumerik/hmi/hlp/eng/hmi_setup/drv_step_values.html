      <p>The reference values are calculated once at the first commissioning of the drive. After this any recalculation is blocked via the p0573 parameter. When creating additional DDS/MDS, for example for star/delta changeover, the reference values are not therefore recalculated.             </p>
      <p>The reference values also act as limits. If this area is not sufficient then these must be adapted manually, for example when adding an additional motor or when operating a feed motor which is far above the nominal speed.</p>
      <p>The reference values act as a standardization between the NC and drive for the actual value acquisition, the setpoint value provision as well as for the measurement functions. All relative values provided e.g. with the Trace refer to these reference values.     </p>
