          <p>
            <b>"Parameter": </b>The parameter settings in the "Radius" and "Feed" input fields must correspond to the values from the part program that controls the circular motion of the axes, taking account of the feed override switch setting.</p>

                <p>The "Measurement time" display field shows the measurement time calculated from the "Radius" and "Feed" values for recording the actual position values during the circular movement: </p>
                <p>If the measurement time is not sufficient then only parts of the circle are portrayed. The measurement time can be increased by reducing the feed value. This also applies if the circularity test is started from the stationary condition.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Set the parameters for displaying the graphic:</p>
                <p>If the measurement time calculated from this exceeds the time range that can be displayed (maximum measurement time = position controller cycle frequency * 2048), an appropriate sample time is calculated for recording (n * position controller cycle frequency), so that a complete circle can be displayed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>To automatically generate a program, with which you traverse the selected axes, press softkey "Generate circle program". The program is displayed for checking purposes and must be confirmed. Ensure that the axes can be traversed according to the program and that the traversing paths are free.</p>

              <li>
                <p>To start the measurement, press the "Start" softkey. The softkeys cannot be used while the measurement is being performed - with the exception of the "Stop" softkey.</p>
