      <p>The measured valve characteristic is not stored in the drive, but a simplified characteristic, defined section-by-section. The sections of the characteristic are defined by 16 parameters.</p>
      <p>After every characteristic measurement, the "Tune valve characteristic" function is called automatically when the "Tuning" dialog is opened the first time. The simplified valve characteristic is generated. You can adapt this simplified valve characteristic as exactly as possible to the measured characteristic in this dialog. You can perform the adaptation as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Entering the parameters</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Editing with the cursor</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can switch between the adjustment types with the softkeys.</p>
      <p>In this dialog, you can tune the valve characteristic by entering parameters. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Automatic tuning</b>
      </p>
      <p>You can perform the automatic tuning with the "Tune valve characteristic" softkey. Through a limited number of iteration increments, the automatic tuning attempts to define the position of the knee points and the gradient of the straight lines so that the sum of the deviations between the individual points of the tuned characteristic is as small as possible to the measured characteristic. <br />To obtain information on the set characteristic, press the "Characteristic information" softkey. </p>
      <p>The positive and negative velocity limits are also calculated during the automatic tuning. They are only displayed in the dialog and cannot be changed.</p>
      <p>The result of the automatic tuning depends on the characteristic set in the drive. If you change the curve points manually and then press the "Tune valve characteristic" softkey, the automatic tuning returns a different tuning result.</p>
      <p>In an incomplete measurement, the controlled system gain and the area adaptation are determined through extrapolation of the measured values. The extrapolation of an incomplete measured characteristic is required when the entire velocity range is to be used during operation of the hydraulic drive although this could not be traversed during the measurement of the valve characteristic.<br />The controlled system gain is the conversion factor between the control voltage and piston velocity Q<sub>max</sub> at U = 100%. The area adaptation is used to compensate the different piston areas of an asymmetric differential cylinder. For the same volume flow (valve control voltage), this results in different piston velocities in the positive and negative direction.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Performing manual tuning</b>
      </p>
      <p>Perform the tuning of the valve characteristic as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Using the cursor keys select the parameter that you want to change. The selected parameter is highlighted in orange in the value field.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Enter the value with the numeric keypad.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Press the ENTER key to update the graphic display of the characteristic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Press the "Accept" softkey to close the tuning of the characteristic. The measured values as well as the measurement parameters and valve characteristic parameters are stored in an XML file. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
