      <p>Interpolation means that all axes in the channel have the same following error. The controllers have different settings once all of the individual axes have been tuned. To standardize the following error, the controllers, including the servo gain factor and feedforward control, are set corresponding to the axis with the slowest response. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Default setting strategy 1105</b>: Adaptation by adding a time constant and retaining the individual equivalent time constants (recommended) </p>
      <p>Interpolating axes with different dynamic responses can be adapted with a time constant as dynamic response adaptation to the slowest control loop. The difference between the equivalent time constants of the slowest control loop and the particular axis should be entered as time constant for the dynamic response adaptation: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>After the axis tuning, different equivalent time constants are adapted with MD32910 $MA _DYN_MATCH_TIME and activated with MD32900 $MA _DYN_MATCH_ENABLE = 1. The time delay is configured as a phase filter with MD32902 $MA _DYN_MATCH_MODE = 1.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With MD32902 $MA _DYN_MATCH_MODE = 0 (PT1 filter), the time constant is adapted in MD32910 $MA _DYN_MATCH_TIME and activated with MD32900 $MA _DYN_MATCH_ENABLE = 1.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following strategies are also available: </p>
      <p>1102: Adaptation by setting the largest equivalent time constants for all of the path axes and moderate reduction of the speed control gain factor</p>
      <p>1103: Adaptation by setting the largest equivalent time constants for all of the path axes</p>
      <p>1104: Interpolation path tuning custom strategy</p>
