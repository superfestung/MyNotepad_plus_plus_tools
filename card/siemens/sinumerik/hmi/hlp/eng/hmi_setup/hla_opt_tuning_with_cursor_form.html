      <p>You can tune the valve characteristic using a graphic cursor in this dialog. The graphic cursor is displayed as a small colored circle in the diagram. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Performing the tuning</b>
      </p>
      <p>You can tune the valve characteristic with the graphic cursor as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>You can use the softkeys to select the range of the characteristic that you want to tune, e.g. positive zero range. The selected range is highlighted in orange in the value field.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Move the graphic cursor in the diagram with the cursor keys. When the cursor reaches the edge of the diagram enlarged with the "Zoom", the displayed area of the diagram is moved. You can move the cursor until the maximum/minimum coordinates are reached.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You can move the characteristic with the graphic cursor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>By pressing the ENTER key, you transfer the pair of values of the cursor coordinates to the line highlighted in orange. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You cannot set the size of the rounding area at the transition between two curve sections (rnd) with the graphic cursor. To do this, you must return to the numeric tuning and enter the values there. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Incomplete measurement</b>
      </p>
      <p>The "End point" softkey is only active for an incomplete measurement if this was planned as complete measurement (up to 100%). The measurement cannot be performed completely if the piston cannot be accelerated to the end velocity because the measurement path is too short.</p>
      <p>The graphic cursor can only be moved vertically at U = ±100% when the "End point" curve range is selected. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>In the positive range, the cursor movement changes the controlled system gain. The value of the area adaptation remains at 100%. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the negative range, the cursor movement changes the negative area adaptation. The value of the controlled system gain remains constant.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Further actions:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Use the softkeys to select the pair of values that you want to change. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Positive range" to select the positive range of the valve characteristic (first quadrant of the coordinate system).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Negative range" to select the negative range of the valve characteristic (third quadrant of the coordinate system).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Zero range" to select the zero range of the valve characteristic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Knee range" to select the knee range of the valve characteristic. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Saturation range" to select the saturation range of the valve characteristic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "End point" to change the controlled system gain and the area adaptation.</p>
          <p>Softkey "End point" is only active for an incomplete characteristic measurement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Back" to return to the numeric input mode.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
