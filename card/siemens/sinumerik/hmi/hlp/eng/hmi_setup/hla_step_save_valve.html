      <p>Additional valve data is entered in this dialog.</p>
      <p>The "Valve number" entry field is preassigned the next free valve number. The valve is uniquely identified in the list by the valve number. You can also enter your own valve number. If you enter an already assigned valve number, you will be prompted whether the data of the existing valve should be overwritten.</p>
      <p>The valve number is not saved in the drive. As SINAMICS does not support a valve code, the valve number is only of significance for the user interface; for example, to be able to search for valves in the valve list based on the valve number.</p>
      <p>You can freely enter text in the entry fields "Manufacturer", Order number" and "Designation".</p>
      <p>Valve data is saved by pressing the "OK" softkey, and then you return to the "Valve data" dialog. </p>
