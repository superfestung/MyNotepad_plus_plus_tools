          <p>
            <b>Duration:</b> The duration of the measurement as a result of the number of measurements, averaging operations, offset velocity, settling time and acceleration time.</p>

            <b>Averages: </b>Number of averaging operations in the time domain, which should be executed during the measurement (= one direction). The higher the number of averaging operations specified, the smoother the result. However, this has the disadvantage that the measurement duration is increased. It is also possible that there is insufficient space; in this case, alternatively the offset velocity can also be reduced.</p>
