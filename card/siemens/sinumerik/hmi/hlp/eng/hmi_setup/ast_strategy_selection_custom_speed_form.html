      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on the tuning objective (robust/moderate/maximum responsiveness), the following is specified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Tuning aggressiveness: The amplitude margin and the phase margin are obtained from this. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Maximum bandwidth</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The tuning aggressiveness extends from 0 (weak = conservative/robust responsiveness) up to 1 (aggressive = maximum responsiveness). Using one parameter, the dynamic response or ruggedness can be selected. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Maximum bandwidth: </b>
      </p>
      <p>The user can limit the dynamic response adaptation of the speed controller. This criterion is applied in addition to the stability criteria listed above. Depending on the tuning objective, it is preassigned 50 Hz / 100 Hz / 300 Hz. </p>
      <p>If the target bandwidth can be achieved, taking into account stability criteria, then the proportional gain Kp for the speed controller is selected so that the speed controller manifests the required bandwidth. Calculating the Kp for the target bandwidth is an approximation assuming that the total moment of inertia is a rigid mass - and the (closed) speed controller can be approximated using a first order lowpass filter (PT1).</p>
      <p>A message can be output if, for other reasons, the required maximum bandwidth cannot be reached. To do this, activate the "Signal if bandwidth was not able to be reached" checkbox.</p>
      <p>Amplitude and phase margins can also be directly entered. The reference model is activated and tuned depending on the predefined strategy. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Minimum integral time Tn:</b>
      </p>
      <p>This input is used to preset a specific degree of ruggedness, for instance if high masses / moments of inertia are expected, but which are not available when performing the measurements. Depending on the tuning objective, it is preassigned 0.015/0.01/0.006 s. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Damping in the current filter:</b>
      </p>
      <p>This allows the amplitude to be reduced in the current setpoint filters according to the notch frequency. This is automatically determined and distributed over several filters. As a result of the damping, it may be possible to eliminate an additional low pass filter. Recommended for linear motors and torque motors. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Current setpoint filter:</b>
      </p>
      <p>A current setpoint filter (PT2 low pass filter at 2000 Hz) is preassigned and activated as standard. This is also reserved for the predefined strategy (303). This means that it is not changed by the automatic servo tuning. The automatic servo tuning automatically sets all of the other filters that have not been reserved.</p>
      <p>If other frequencies are known, which must be filtered, but cannot be measured at the actual time of the measurement, then the filters required for this purpose can already be entered and reserved in advance, e.g. oscillation for the brake test, standstill oscillation (> 100 Hz). These reserved filters are then taken into account in the controller setting, however they are not automatically changed.</p>
      <p>The actual speed value filters are handled in a comparable way as the current setpoints filters. If it is already known that actual value filters are required, then these can be preset and reserved here, e.g. for certain encoder types (noisy encoder signals). In this case, a pre-assignment is not made when selecting the strategy.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>"<a href="45720875915.html">Adapt strategy</a>" softkey to adapt the settings of a predefined strategy. The values of the predefined strategy are copied to the user strategy (309). When selecting the user-defined strategy, this softkey is not active.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Filter details" softkey to select or adapt a filter. This softkey can only be used when selecting a filter in the user-defined strategy.</p>

          <p>"<a href="ast_strategy_selection_custom_axis_form.html">Axis</a>" and "<a href="ast_strategy_selection_custom_position_form.html">Position</a>" softkeys to toggle between axis and position controller when selecting a strategy.</p>
          <p>If a strategy without feedforward control (FFWOF) is selected, this selection should be made for all interpolating axes. At the latest during the tuning of the path interpolation, the feedforward control is also deactivated for the other path axes. </p>

        <li>
          <p>"Cancel" and "OK" softkeys to cancel or accept the new settings.</p>
