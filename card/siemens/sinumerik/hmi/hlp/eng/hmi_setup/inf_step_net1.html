                <p class="safety">If p3410 = 5 is saved in the commissioning archive, then the line/DC link identification starts automatically once the drive data is input into the archive.</p>

          <p>Enter the device connection voltage: This is the basis for monitoring the line voltage (p0281 - p0283), whereby an alarm is triggered in the case of an overshoot or undershoot. (Alarm threshold and shutdown threshold). The actual line voltage is determined automatically and the adjustment is made based on this value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The actual line frequency for the infeed is determined automatically.</p>
          <p>In parameters p0284, p0285, set a threshold above which an alarm is triggered (default setting of the monitoring: 45 Hz to 65 Hz).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Quick stop for axes when the voltage dips after a delay time in [ms]: </p>
          <p>In the event of a voltage dip, alarm 207862 "External fault 3" followed by alarm 207841 "Infeed operation withdrawn" are triggered, and the associated fault response is initiated from p2101. If an alarm is not to be initiated for very short voltage dips, this can be configured with the ON-delay time p2101. </p>
          <p>The switch-on delay is not active for each specific drive, but per infeed – and therefore for all the drives connected to this infeed. Alarms, for example, from the DC link, are not involved - and are still initiated.</p>
