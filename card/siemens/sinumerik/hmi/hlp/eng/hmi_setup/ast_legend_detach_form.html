      <p>Description of the signals<b>:</b> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Closed control loop without feedforward control, calculated: The position control loop is calculated based on the measurements of the speed-controlled system and mechanical frequency response including controller parameters and filter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Open control loop: Calculated open position control loop, including speed setpoint filter, scaled with 1/(servo gain factor):</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Controlled system: Controlled system of the position control loop without speed setpoint filter, scaled with 1/(Kv factor):</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Mechanical frequency response: Transfer response from the motor encoder up to the load encoder (2nd encoder)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Coherence, mechanical frequency response: Shows the coherence in addition to the Bode diagram.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Closed speed control loop, calculated:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Closed control loop with feedforward control, calculated: The feedforward controller generates a higher bandwidth of the setpoints; as a consequence, generally the amplitude response has higher values. If required, this can be smoothed/filtered using speed setpoint filter 2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>n filter: Speed setpoint filter (transfer function of both filters):</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Disturbance frequency response: Input signal: Torque; output signal: Load position = compliance:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Disturbance frequency response torque: Input signal: Torque; output signal: Torque setpoint after the current setpoint filter:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Diagrams calculated from "Manual" column:</b> Shows the calculated frequency responses, which were calculated with the values from the "Manual" parameter column. The user can adapt these. The frequency response can also be updated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Active diagrams:</b> Shows the calculated frequency responses which were calculated with the values from the parameter column ("Manual"/"Original"). If tuning has been performed previously with the automatic servo tuning and no parameters have been changed manually, these are the currently effective parameters in the NC and in the drive.</p>
