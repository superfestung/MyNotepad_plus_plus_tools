      <p>If you enter invalid or inconsistent values while tuning the valve characteristic, the "Error messages" dialog is displayed. The errors that have occurred are listed. </p>
      <p>The following error messages can be output:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Gradient positive knee range ≤ 0</p>
          <p>The Q value of the positive zero range is greater than or equal to the Q value of the positive knee range.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Gradient positive saturation range ≤ 0</p>
          <p>The Q value of the positive knee range is greater than or equal to the Q value of the positive saturation range.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Positive saturation range reverses</p>
          <p>The characteristic does not go into the saturation in the positive saturation range.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Positive zero range overlaps knee range</p>
          <p>The positive zero range and the positive knee range including rounding overlap.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Gradient negative knee range ≤ 0</p>
          <p>The Q value of the negative zero range is less than or equal to the Q value of the negative knee range.</p>
