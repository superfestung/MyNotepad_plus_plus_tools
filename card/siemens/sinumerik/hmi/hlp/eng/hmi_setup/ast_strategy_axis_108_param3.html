            <p class="safety">While measuring a speed-controlled system it makes sense to weaken the speed controller to minimize its influence. The reduction of the gains for the speed controller (p1460) and position controller (MD32200) and integral time (p1462) is automatically preassigned. If, when making the measurement, the axis does not move as expected, then p1460 should be increased during the measurement.</p>
            <p class="safety">The current setpoint filters are also switched off during the measurement because their setting cannot be checked at this time. It may be necessary to activate current setpoint filters during the measurement. The user must then appropriately set p1656 (e.g. 1H for the first filter, 3H for both filters). </p>
