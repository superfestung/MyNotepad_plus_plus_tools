          <p>The "Change" softkey makes subsequent changes and other settings on the displayed drive object, e.g. assign the encoders. For motors with DRIVE-CLiQ all the information is ascertained with the automatic device configuration. Commissioning is not required. Commissioning is required for motors without DRIVE-CLiQ, so-called "third-party motors". The motor data is entered via the "Change" softkey.</p>
