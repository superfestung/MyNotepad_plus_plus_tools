        <b>JOG mode: Meaning of the options</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Perform all measurements of each measurement series with the first NC start:</p>
          <p>All repeats (e.g. motion in the positive and negative axis direction) within a measurement series are started automatically.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Start measurements automatically:</p>
          <p>The start screen of each measurement series is skipped and the measurement process is directly started with the default measurement parameters.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Automatic confirmation of the measurement:</p>
          <p>The measurement result is not displayed. This is only recommended when a fully automatic tuning is required. The measurement cannot be repeated and improved through a variation of the measurement parameters.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Automatic acknowledgement of the controller data:</p>
          <p>The "Controller data overview" display is skipped. The controller data determined by the algorithm is directly activated. The parameters determined by the algorithm can no longer be controlled or changed during the tuning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Automatic data activation using the operator panel reset:</p>
          <p>The "Operator panel reset" signal is generated by the algorithm. If this option is deactivated, the "Operator panel reset" is requested via a message.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Automatically backup drive boot files (ACX format):</p>
          <p>After completing the tuning of a machine axis, the drive data is automatically saved on the CompactFlash card in the ACX format. If this option is deactivated, a query is made. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Allow strategy selection during tuning:</p>
          <p>The dialog to select the tuning strategies for the speed controller and position controller is displayed. This option is not recommended for a fully automatic tuning. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Perform preliminary measurement to determine the excitation:</p>
          <p>A preceding, additional measurement is performed to more precisely determine the measurement parameters for each measurement series. This is recommended when measuring directly driven machine axes for the first time. This option is only relevant for cases in which a predefined tuning strategy has been selected. You can select this option for the user-defined strategy. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Switch off gantry consistency check:</p>
          <p>The checking of the controller parameters in the gantry axis grouping is switched off with this option. Axes in a gantry axis grouping are first tuned in succession. On completion of the tuning, a check is made as to whether the controller parameters of the individual axes in the gantry axis grouping are identical. If the dynamic response varies too much, a message is output. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Suppress all warnings for measurements</p>
          <p>No warnings are output during the measurement. Activation of this option is only recommended for experienced commissioning engineers and is only required when the automatic servo tuning is to be performed without queries. Prerequisite is that the automatic servo tuning has been tested previously (and, if required, the strategy selection and measurement parameters have been adapted).</p>
