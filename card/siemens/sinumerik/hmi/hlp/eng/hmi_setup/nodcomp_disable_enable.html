      <p>To analyze the effect of the nodding compensation on the machining, you can deactivate individual or all compensation relationships without deleting the original parameterization. Deactivation is useful for the following applications: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Diagnostics and problem analysis: </p>
          <p>The effect of a specific compensation relationship on the workpiece surface should be tested. Because a superimposition of compensation relationships from different axes and different compensation relationships is possible, the effect of an individual or all successive compensation relationships should be tested. For this purpose, the compensation is deactivated temporarily; the determined compliance values are retained. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Series commissioning: </p>
          <p>The compensation values are loaded via the series commissioning archive and can be deactivated during the machine tuning, to tune the machine without the effect of the nodding compensation. On completion of the tuning, the compensation values are reactivated. As check, a test part can be milled. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
