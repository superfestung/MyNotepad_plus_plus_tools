      <p>When the dialog opens, the characteristic set in the drive is displayed first. After a measurement, the measured characteristic and the characteristic set in the drive are displayed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Requirement for the characteristic measurement</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the following requirements must be satisfied before starting the measurement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>All adjustments have been performed manually in the "<a href="hla_opt_matching_form.html">Adjustment</a>" dialog.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The setting "Characteristic measurement with identification" has been selected at "Measurement" in the "<a href="hla_opt_start_form.html">Measure valve characteristic</a>" dialog. The adjustments are performed automatically with this setting. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you start the measurement without a previous adjustment, a corresponding prompt is displayed. The axis must be in the referenced state for both adjustment types. If this condition is not satisfied, a prompt appears.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Start of the characteristic measurement</b>
      </p>
      <p>You start the characteristic measurement with the "Start measurement" softkey. The current axis position is displayed in a bar diagram. The measurement may take several minutes. The labeling of the "Start meas." softkey changes to "Stop meas.". All other softkeys are disabled. </p>
      <p>You can stop the measurement with the "Stop meas." softkey. No measured characteristic is then displayed in the diagram. An error message is not displayed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Result of the characteristic measurement</b>
      </p>
      <p>When the drive has completed the measurement, the measurement results are available in parameters r1961[0..511] and r1962[0..511]. </p>
      <p>After completion of the measurement, the success or failure is output as a message. The softkeys are activated again.</p>
      <p>If the measurement is successful, the measured data is displayed in the diagram as a characteristic. An automatic tuning of the set characteristic is performed. The tuned, set characteristic is displayed in the "Graphic tuning" dialog.</p>
      <p>If the measurement fails, an error message is output. Rectify the problem and perform the measurement again. </p>
      <p>To cancel the drive disable after the measurement, you must press the RESET button on the machine control panel. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Further actions:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Start the measurement of the valve characteristic with the "Start meas." softkey. The labeling of the "Start meas." softkey changes to "Stop meas." after the measurement is started. All other softkeys are disabled during the measurement. The measurement progress is displayed in a progress bar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Stop the measurement of the valve characteristic with the "Stop meas." softkey. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Meas. parameters >" to open the "<a href="hla_opt_measure_params_form.html">Measurement parameters</a>" dialog. The measurement parameters are displayed there in a parameter list. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Zoom >" to display the "Zoom" softkey bar. The "Measurement" dialog remains unchanged. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "Abort" to return to the "<a href="hla_opt_start_form.html">Measure valve characteristic</a>" dialog. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Softkey "OK" to open the "<a href="hla_opt_tuning_with_cursor_form.html">Graphic tuning</a>" dialog.</p>
