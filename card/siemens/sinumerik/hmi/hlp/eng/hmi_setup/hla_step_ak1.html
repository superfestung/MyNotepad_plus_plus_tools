      <p>In the overview of the drive object hydraulic linear drive (HLA), all the data is displayed, which was capable of being determined with the automatic device configuration. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Further actions:</b>   </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>You can scroll between all of the drive objects using the "Drive +" and "Drive -" softkeys. If the actual drive object is a hydraulic linear drive, the overview page of the HLA commissioning wizard is displayed. If the actual drive object is a servo drive, then the overview page of the servo commissioning wizard is displayed. These softkeys are only active if there are several drives.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You open the direct selection dialog using the "Select drive" softkey. This dialog displays all servo and HLA drive objects. This softkey is only active if there are several drives. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The "Change" softkey makes subsequent changes and other settings on the displayed drive object, e.g. assign the encoders.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The "Encoder data" softkey opens a window for subsequent configuration of the assigned encoders.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With the "Axis assignment" softkey, you open the dialog to assign the HLA drive to an NC axis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With the "Reference variables" softkey, you open the dialog to enter reference variables.</p>
