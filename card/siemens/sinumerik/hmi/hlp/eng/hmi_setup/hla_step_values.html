      <p>In this dialog you define reference variables for velocity, pressure, force, power, angle and acceleration. The reference variables are calculated once at the first commissioning of the drive. </p>
      <p>In order to prevent reference values being calculated, activate the "Inhibit automatic reference value calculation" option.</p>
      <p>The reference variables act as a standardization between the NC and drive for the actual value acquisition, the setpoint value provision as well as for the measurement functions. All of the quantities specified as relative value refer to these reference quantities. The reference variables additionally act as limits. If this range is not sufficient, you must adapt the reference variables manually. </p>
      <p>The reference variables are not dependent on the parameter set. You can define as to whether reference variables should be automatically preassigned using parameter p0340.0. </p>
