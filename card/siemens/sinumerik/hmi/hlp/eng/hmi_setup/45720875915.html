      <p>Here, the user can select how aggressive or how rugged the closed-loop control should be. The dynamic response of a control loop depends on its controlled system and its sample time. If a control loop includes transfer elements with longer time constants, then the higher-level controller must be adapted to these transfer elements. This means that the maximum gain and therefore the maximum dynamic response of this control loop is limited. For instance, a very high load moment of inertia that is coupled to the motor through a (finitely stiff) spring, has a large time constant. </p>
      <p>High control gains result in short response times to setpoint inputs and disturbance variables. The poor damping is a disadvantage (high overshoot, low damping factor for oscillations). Further, it must be noted that the controller is less rugged, and therefore sensitive to mechanical changes. </p>
      <p>The default settings for speed and position controllers are adapted by selecting the tuning objective. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Maximum responsiveness</b>
            <b>:</b>
          </p>
          <p>The speed and position controller gain (servo gain factor) is tuned with maximum values and minimum ruggedness. </p>
          <p>Application: High-speed machining with maximum suppression of all disturbing forces such as friction, teeth of the drive belt, strong cutting forces, when machining titanium, for example. Recommended for high-speed machining with linear motors. </p>
          <p>Requirement: The machine must have a rigid design; the dynamic masses do not change significantly. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Moderate responsiveness</b>
            <b>:</b>
          </p>
          <p>This controller dynamic response is sufficient for the majority of machines and applications. The setting is more rugged than "Maximum responsiveness".</p>
          <p>Application: The inertia or the load mass of the axes does not change much and therefore this setting is suitable for numerous applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Conservative/robust responsiveness</b>
            <b>:</b>
          </p>
          <p>Only weak control gains are selected in order to ensure as high a level of ruggedness as possible.</p>
          <p>The speed controller is tuned so that it achieves maximum damping to prevent oscillations and to achieve good position controller gain. </p>
          <p>Application: Recommended for machines on which the mechanical axis system or the load mass can change significantly. Also suitable for axes that react with oscillations, e.g. main spindles on turning machines or large axes with high load mass.</p>
          <p>Recommended for applications with low requirements on the machining time.</p>
