      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Here you configure additional motor data: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Motor holding brake configuration:</p>
          <p>If a connected brake is recognized during the device configuration, then the system automatically activates the brake control and displays "Brake control as sequence control" as the default setting (terminals on the Motor Module).</p>
          <p>Motor holding brake always open: For diagnostic purposes the brake opens permanently.</p>
          <p>If no brake is detected, "No motor brake available" is activated:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Extended brake control" function module: </p>
          <p>The extended brake control function also activates parameters in order to carry out more complex brake control operations, e.g. approaching the brake. You can find more details on this in the function diagrams in the SINAMICS S120 List Manual /LH1/ - in the Chapter "Function Modules".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Brake control diagnostics evaluation:</p>
          <p>For an AC drive with "Safe Brake Relay," the "Safe Brake Control" function requires that the type of the brake control be set in parameter p1278, to "Brake control with diagnostic evaluation" (p1278 = 0). This parameter is automatically set for booksize components.</p>
          <p>BICO terminals: r0899.12 "Open holding brake" must be connected to a terminal on the Control Unit, e.g. to terminal DO14: p0744 = BICO 3:899.12 </p>
          <p>Brake control after sequence control, connection via BICO: Enables the control of an external brake which is not connected via the terminals on the Motor Module. There is no monitoring of the brake here. The control occurs via SINAMICS.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Overvoltage protection </h3>
      <p>Please note the advice regarding the overvoltage protection for high-speed Siemens motors: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If you have connected a Voltage Protection Module (VPM) then activate the checkbox.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If no VPM is connected then the speed is limited in order to prevent the drive from being destroyed.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <a name="block_2">

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Bearing version </h3>
      <p>The "Bearing version" selection is only offered when this motor is available with different bearing versions. </p>
      <p>You can set the bearing type here: Thus, the speed is limited to the maximum speed of the bearing in order to prevent mechanical destruction. When "No specification" is selected, the maximum speed of the bearing is not monitored. </p>
      <a name="block_3">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Motor temperature sensor</h3>
      <p>Depending on the drive parameter assignment, only specific temperature sensor types are supported. </p>
      <p>As parts of the actual drive parameter assignment are only calculated when actuating the "Finish" softkey at the end of the drive commissioning wizard, it may occur that in the current dialog some temperature sensor types are marked with the following note: "*) Motor temperature sensor type is not supported by the actual drive parameter assignment". This marking disappears once the drive has been commissioned if the selected motor temperature sensor is supported by the drive parameter assignment. Select the motor temperature sensor type according to the motor data sheet if it is marked with *) in the selection list.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Technological application (p0500) </h3>
      <p>The "Technological application" selection list is only displayed when selecting a third-party synchronous rotary motor. Here you can set whether it is a spindle drive or feed drive, so that the limits and standardizations are calculated accordingly.</p>
