      <p>Strategy "303 With reference model and retaining the 2000 Hz current setpoint filter" is the recommended strategy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tuning aggressiveness:</b> Factor in the range from 0 to 1</p>
      <p>0: Means very weak but rugged speed controller. </p>
      <p>0.5: Means a compromise between a rugged and a dynamic speed controller.</p>
      <p>1: Means a very dynamic speed controller, but sensitive to mechanical changes.</p>
      <p>Depending on this factor, the <b>amplitude margin</b> and the <b>phase margin</b> are calculated automatically.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reference model active: </b>
      </p>
      <p>Recommendation: Carry out the measurement using the reference model.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Maximum bandwidth:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here, the user can limit the transfer behavior of the speed controller. This criterion is applied in addition to the stability criteria listed above. Depending on the tuning objective (robust/moderate/maximum responsiveness), it is preassigned 50 Hz / 100 Hz / 300 Hz. </p>
      <p>A message can be output if, for other reasons, the required maximum bandwidth cannot be reached. To do this, activate the "Signal if bandwidth was not able to be reached" checkbox.</p>
      <p>Amplitude and phase margins can also be directly entered. The reference model is activated and tuned depending on the predefined strategy. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Minimum integral time Tn:</b>
      </p>
      <p>This input is used to preset a specific degree of ruggedness, for instance if high masses / moments of inertia are expected, but which are not available when performing the measurements. Depending on the tuning objective (robust/moderate/maximum responsiveness), this value is preassigned 0.015/0.01/0.006 s.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Damping in the current setpoint filter: </b>
      </p>
      <p>A current setpoint filter (PT2 low pass filter at 2000 Hz) is preassigned and activated as standard. This is also reserved for the predefined strategy (303). This means that it is not changed by the automatic servo tuning. The automatic servo tuning automatically sets all of the other filters that have not been reserved.</p>
      <p>If other frequencies are known, which must be filtered, but cannot be measured at the actual time of the measurement, then the filters required for this purpose can already be entered and reserved in advance, e.g. oscillation for the brake test, standstill oscillation (> 100 Hz). These reserved filters are then taken into account in the controller setting, however they are not automatically changed.</p>

        <b>⇒ Further actions:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>"Adapt strategy" softkey to adapt the pre-assigned values of a predefined strategy. The user-defined strategy (309) is assigned the values of the predefined strategy. All parameters can be set in the "User-defined strategy". The tuning objective "Moderate responsiveness" is the presetting for the "User-defined strategy".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Meas. parameters >" softkey to adapt the parameters for a measurement. This softkey is only active when "User-defined strategy" is selected. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"<a href="ast_strategy_select_cust_axis_108.html">Axis</a>" softkey and "<a href="ast_strategy_select_cust_position_209.html">Position</a>" softkey to toggle between axis and position controller when selecting a strategy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Cancel" and "OK" softkeys to cancel or accept the new settings.</p>
