      <p>Torque feedforward control is also needed in the spindle for tapping. Torque feedforward control is also recommended for all the other path axes. The optimization of the spindle is already completed with the optimization of the individual spindle modes. </p>
      <p>Make sure that the spindle has been optimized for all of the required gear stages.</p>
      <p>Recommended path calibration: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>For the tapping, a path calibration between the corresponding gear stage of the spindle and the path axis involved is required. This ensures that the following error is the same in both axes. For the sake of simplicity, the gear stage of the spindle is calibrated with all of the path axes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The spindle is first calibrated in axis mode with all of the gear stages to ensure that the following error is the same in every mode. Following this, the path axes are calibrated in succession with the spindle. All of the parameter sets are also calibrated for the tapping to ensure that all of the gear stages and all of the path axes are calibrated with the spindle.</p>
