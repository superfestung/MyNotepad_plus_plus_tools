      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>For main spindles of milling machines, the speed and position mode (SPOS) is mostly needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The spindle is in axis mode if it is operated as a rotary axis (C-axis) with the path axes along the path. This is rarely required for the main spindle of a milling machine. The rotary table of the milling machine is defined as a spindle to also allow turning operations using the milling machine. The rotary table is then operated as a C-axis, even though it is declared as a spindle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For main spindles on turning machines, all modes are usually needed.</p>
