      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Make the following selection with both of these checkboxes:   </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Default: "SINUMERIK-compliant interconnection for the terminal wiring"</p>
          <p>This means that the BICO interconnections for the terminal wiring are set in such a way that all releases and responses communicate correctly.</p>
          <p>If the option is not activated (checkbox is not selected), then changes have been made in the BICO interconnection in relation to the standard interconnection. If these changes were not intended you can use the "Set standard terminal wiring set" option to restore the SINUMERIK compliant interconnection.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Option: "Set BICO connections for the standard terminal wiring"</p>
          <p>Enable this option in order to set the standard terminal wiring. This means that the configuration is interconnected in compliance with SINUMERIK. </p>

        <b>BICO interconnection for 2nd OFF2:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 2nd OFF2 signal of this drive can be wired up to one of the terminals in the selection list. When selecting a distinction is made as to whether the drive is connected to a CU or NX. For a Control Unit, connection can be made to terminal block X132 and for an NX expansion module, connection can be made to terminal block X122.</p>
      <p>If a terminal is selected which is already being used on another drive, then the following options are available: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>"Replace available terminal assignment by the drive"</p>
          <p>The terminal assignment already existing on this terminal is removed in other drives. A new terminal assignment is established to this drive alone. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Add drive of the existing terminal assignment"</p>
          <p>The new assignment to this terminal is established in addition to the already existing terminal assignments for this drive. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
