      <p>The following requirements must be satisfied before the three adjustments are performed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Position adjustment</p>
          <p>The axis must be referenced and the piston must be at position A (DE endstop).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Pressure equalization</p>
          <p>The system must be in the no pressure state.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Valve offset adjustment</p>
          <p>The axis must be in closed-loop control operation.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To perform the adjustments, press the "Position adjustment", "Pressure adjustment" and "Valve offset adjustment" softkeys in this sequence. The progress of the respective adjustment is displayed.</p>
      <p>If required, change the offset values for the pressure sensors, the D/A conversion and the piston zero point.  </p>
