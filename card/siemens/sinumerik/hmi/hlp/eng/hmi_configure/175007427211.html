During the import, a message is displayed in the status bar of the trace window.</p></td></tr></table><a name="block_2"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Searching in the variable selection list</h3><p>The variable list includes a description of the variables with their OPI address (NC variables) or symbolic name (PLC variables). For PLC variables for 840D/828D, the tooltip of the "Address/Symbol" field displays both the symbol and the corresponding memory address. PLC1500 variables only have a symbolic name.</p><p>The selection window contains a filter dropdown list for selecting variable categories and a search input field. A search is made for the text that you type into the search field in the description text and under the addresses and symbol of those variables that are visible according to the selected filter category. The search is not case sensitive.</p><p>For 840D / 828D PLC variables, the search expression will be searched also in the memory address (even though the address is only visible in the tooltip). Therefore you can find these variables either by typing in a part of the symbol or a part of the data block address.</p><a name="block_3"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Inserting drive trace variables</h3><p>The variable selection window for a drive trace configuration functions similar to the NC/PLC trace configuration, but displays different data.</p><p>The filter drop-down list displays the list of drive objects that exist on the machine. The list of variables display only those parameters that belong to the selected drive object.</p><p>You can search in the variable list by entering text into the "Search" input field. A search is made for the characters that have been entered in the parameter numbers and also in the parameter names (this is not case sensitive).</p><p>You can add the selected variable to the trace configuration by clicking the "Add" softkey. This inserts both the variable and the drive object into the signal table.</p><p>A variable can also be added by dragging from the selection list and dropping into the signal table (multiple selection is not allowed).</p><p>When you add a drive object that belongs to a different Control Unit than the other drive objects in the configuration, the previously selected drive objects become invalid. A confirmation prompt is displayed before this operation is executed.</p></div>
