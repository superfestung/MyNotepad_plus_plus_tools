      <p>For the channel menu, a logical view is defined across all of the channels of all NCUs involved; this logical view is structured in channel groups and this in turn in specific NC channels. </p>
      <p>A channel group list is defined for the channel menu in order to be able to switch over operation. A channel group list comprises one or several channel groups. In turn, a channel group comprises one or several NC channels.</p>
      <p>In the channel menu, the channel groups can be selected using the horizontal softkeys.</p>
      <p>The channels of a selected channel group can be selected with the vertical softkeys. </p>
      <p>A certain NC channel of a specific NCU is always a switchover target that can be selected. A switchover to another channel triggered via the channel menu can implicitly mean switchover to another NCU.</p>
