      <p>The FFT diagram has its own pair of <a href="175458451211.html">measurement cursors</a>. These measurement cursors can be used similarly to the cursors in the trace diagram. The cursor labels can display the frequency and amplitude values at the current position of the cursors, as well as the frequency and amplitude difference between the two cursor positions.</p>
      <p>While the measurement cursors in the trace widget are hidden during trace recording, the FFT cursors can remain visible even while a recording is running. The displayed values in their labels will be dynamically updated, as the diagram is recalculated continuously.</p>
      <p>The cursor table widget is only available for the trace diagram, not for FFT.</p>
