      <p>To display selected bits of the measured value in the trace chart, you can define a bit mask in the hexadecimal format. This is only available for variables with an integer data type. The bit mask can be defined before recording, but it can also be changed any time after the recording.</p>
      <p>When the bit mask is changed for a signal that has measured data and does not belong to a scaling group, the vertical zoom range of the signal is automatically adjusted, so that the new value range of the signal curve is visible. This zoom change can be undone with the "undo zoom" icon on the toolbar.</p>
      <p>If the bit mask selects a single bit, the signal curve displays the value of the bit as 0 or 1. If the bit mask selects several bits, the signal curve shows the numeric value of the measured data after applying the bit mask.</p>
