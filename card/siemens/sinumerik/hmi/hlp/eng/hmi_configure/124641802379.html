      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>IP address of the adapter: 192.168.215.30, subnet mask 255.255.255.224</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>IP address of the caller: 192.168.215.29</p>
          <p>These two addresses are also stored as standard in the "tcu.ini" file. If other addresses are used, then appropriately change the entries "X127ModemIP" and "X127RemoteAccessIP" in the "tcu.ini" file.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Enable the ports for the services for S7 communication, http, HTTPS, SSH as well as VNC (port 5900) in the firewall.</p>
