      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">What is user management?</h3>
      <p>User management refers to various activities that involve managing the users of all systems and applications in a company or organization. Usually, the administrator is the one who performs these activities and/or coordinates them. </p>
      <p>User management offers the following functions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Protection of IT systems and data against unauthorized access (both internal and external)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Unique identification of each user (e.g. through a combination of user name and password)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Changing the password when required</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Assignment of access authorizations to systems, services, and applications</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Prompt blocking or deletion of accounts and authorizations when they are no longer needed (e.g. when a user leaves the company)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Local and central user management</h3>
      <p>There are two ways in which the administrator can manage users: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>locally (internally)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>central (via a UMC server)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For local user management, the administrator creates the users directly in the respective system. </p>
      <p>For central user management, the various systems and applications are connected to an external user management system, such as an "Active Directory", where the users are managed centrally.</p>
      <p>As an alternative to authorization using the previous access levels, the SINUMERIK system optionally features <b>local and central user management</b>.</p>
