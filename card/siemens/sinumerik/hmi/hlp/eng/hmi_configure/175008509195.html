      <p>Toggling between "Move" and "Zoom" mode ("hand" and "rectangle" mode) is possible from the context menu or from the toolbar.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">If "Move" mode is selected:</h4>
      <p>The basis mouse cursor has the shape of a hand. Using the hand-shaped cursor, click on an empty background area and drag this with the left-hand mouse key pressed: Shift the whole trace diagram, in the drag direction.</p>
      <p>When the CTRL key is pressed, the mouse cursor changes to the <a href="175008513931.html">"Zoom"</a> mode as long as the key is kept pressed. This way it is possible to <a href="175008516619.html">draw a "rectangle"</a> in "Move" mode.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">If "Zoom" is selected:</h4>
      <p>The basis mouse cursor is an arrow. Press the left mouse button on an empty background area and drag: Draw a "rectangle". When the mouse key is released, the diagram will be zoomed in to the area enclosed by the rectangle.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">In both the "Move" and "Zoom" modes:</h4>
      <p>The mouse cursor changes to the pointing hand shape over signal curves and vertical scales, which can be dragged. Using the hand-shaped cursor, click on a signal curve and drag it with the left mouse button pressed: The signal curve is individually shifted. The other signals are not shifted and the active signal is not changed.</p>
      <p>If the selected signal is part of a signal group, then all signals in the group are shifted together.</p>
