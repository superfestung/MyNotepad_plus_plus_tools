      <p>When a trace session file created in this application is loaded, signal data such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Identifiers of the axis and channel parameters of signals</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Identifiers of the drive objects</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Physical units, data types, array indices, etc.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>are displayed in the signal table as they were at the time of the measurement when the session file was saved.</p>
      <p>The data can also be loaded and displayed correctly if the user interface is offline, connected to another machine, or if the machine configuration has changed and the loaded data is no longer valid.</p>
      <p>The description texts of NC variables are displayed in the currently selected language, even if the session file was saved with a different language setting.</p>
      <p>Session files stored in this trace application are protected with a verification code that can be used to determine if the contents of the file have been modified outside the application. If an external change is detected when opening a file, an error message is displayed and the session file cannot be loaded.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Compatibility mode</h3>
      <p>The trace application can load session files created in the SINUMERIK Operate function <b>Trace classic</b> or in <b>SinuCom NC</b> in compatibility mode, which is displayed in the title bar of the trace interface. In this mode, the trace configuration is write-protected. You cannot add or delete variables, or change the parameters of the variables. Only visualization settings like colors, line styles, etc. can be edited.</p>
      <p>Session files saved by the applications mentioned above do not contain all the information about the signal characteristics at the time of measurement. Therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that all data displayed in the signal table is correct.</p>

            <p class="safety">When a session file is loaded in compatibility mode, most of the signal properties, e.g. axis and channel identifiers, physical units, GUD definitions, etc., are determined from the current machine configuration.</p>
            <p class="safety">The information displayed is only correct if the session file is loaded on the same machine on which it was created and the device settings have not changed.</p>

      <p>The data types of NC variables are displayed as they are loaded from the session file. However, if the session contains PLC memory addresses or 840D/828D PLC variables, their data types are redetermined according to the current configuration. A pop-up message is displayed if the application has changed the data type of a PLC variable.</p>
      <p>If you save the configuration from this application again, it remains in compatibility mode.</p>
      <p>To create an editable trace configuration, start a new trace session.</p>
