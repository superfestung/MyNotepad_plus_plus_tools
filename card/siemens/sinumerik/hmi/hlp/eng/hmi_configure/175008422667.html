It is a toggle symbol that can be switched on and off.</p><p>When the symbol is toggled on, the current horizontal visible range and the current vertical scaling of all signals is preserved when a new trace recording is started. During and after a new measurement, as long as the symbol is switched on and no other zooming or scaling operation is used, then the visible area of the trace diagram will not change.</p><p>The symbol will be automatically switched off and deactivated when the trace configuration is changed (signals are added or deleted or an axis parameter is changed), or when a new trace configuration is created.</p><p>If a trace session file is loaded which already contains measurement data, the symbol is active; however, it is switched off as default setting.</p></div>
