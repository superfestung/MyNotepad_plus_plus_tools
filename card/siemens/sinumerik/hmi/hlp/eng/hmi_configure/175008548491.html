      <p>The "Signal scales" context menu is structured in mutually exclusive groups. Tenth division and value-based division are mutually exclusive as one group and scales of all signals, scale of selected signal and selected scales are mutually exclusive as another option group.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>"Tenth division": The menu item means that the major scale divisions and their corresponding labels on vertical scales are only displayed for numbers which are the product of a factor of 10. Example: 10, 20, 30 or 1, 2, 3 or 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.</p>
          <p>Small scale divisions between the major scale divisions are only displayed if the diagram is zoomed in so much that less than five scale divisions are displayed on the visible vertical scale.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Value-based division": The menu item shows that the main scale divisions and their labels are displayed as frequently as possible without the labels overlapping. The intervals between the labels remains consistent and small scale divisions are displayed between the main scale divisions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Scales of all signals": The vertical scales of all visible signals are displayed, drawn parallel next to each other. This command does not change the position of the scale (to the left or right of the widget), if they had been previously changed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Scale of the selected signal": Only the vertical scale of the currently selected signal is displayed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>"Selected scales": For each individual signal, you can select whether the vertical scales should be visible or not.</p>

          <p>The "Customize scales" menu item opens the configuration table for signal scales, in which you can select the visibility and position for the vertical scales.</p>
