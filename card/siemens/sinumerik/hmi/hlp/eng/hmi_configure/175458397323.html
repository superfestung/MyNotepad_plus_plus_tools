      <p>When starting a trace recording, the determined data is continuously displayed in the trace chart during recording. The visible display of the trace chart is automatically shifted to the right (scroll display) so that the last recorded time interval (the last few seconds) is always visible on the horizontal scale. If the ring buffer is configured in the stop trigger settings, the chart shows the contents of the ring buffer. The diagram display is also continuously shifted and scaled vertically so that the last measured data is always in the vertical display area.</p>
      <p>If the "Preserve scaling" symbol is activated, the trace chart is not moved during recording. However, if the signal data is in the visible area of the trace chart, it is still displayed in real time.</p>
      <p>While recording, the trace configuration cannot be changed and most visualization options (e.g. zooming) are also disabled. When the recording is running with continuous visualization, the following functions remain active and can be used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Changing the visibility of signal curves</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Changing the color, line width and line style of signal curves</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Changing the vertical scale selection (selected / all scales) and the scale position (left / right / hidden) via the context menu</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Arranging signal curves in tracks (only when the "Preserve scaling" symbol is deactivated)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the "Arrangement in tracks" function is used during continuous visualization, the new arrangement will continue till end of the recording. When recording is stopped, the trace widget sets the display arrangement to the default view (all measured data visible).</p>
      <p>Continuous visualization is not possible in the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A session file is loaded in compatibility mode and the session is configured to record the trace results on the controller.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A drive trace recording was started.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In these cases, a message is displayed in the trace widget during recording. It explains why continuous visualization is not possible. The recorded data are displayed after the recording has ended.</p>
