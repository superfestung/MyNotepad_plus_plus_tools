      <p>If you want to create a new user, you can use the "Create user" dialog. You can create local users independent of whether your domain is connected with a central user management or not.</p>

The complete name (or the initials) are used to identify the user in the login button. The user name is used if a complete name has not been saved.

                <p>Optionally, select whether you wish to lock individual users so that they cannot log into the system. For example, if a user temporarily leaves the company, you can lock the user account instead of closing it.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Also directly assign users a machine role. <br />For example, this can make sense if you create additional Security Admins besides the standard Security Admins of the domain. You can then directly link the user with machine role "Security Admin". This means that you can prevent that the local user group is possibly deleted when connecting with the central user management.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Assign a user group to the user if you have already created it. To do this, select one or more user groups to which the user should belong. </p>

              <li>
                <p>Now click "OK" to add the new user to the list of users. If necessary, create additional users by repeating steps 2-7.</p>
