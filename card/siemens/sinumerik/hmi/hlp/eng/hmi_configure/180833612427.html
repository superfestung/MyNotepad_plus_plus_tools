      <p>To restore the previous visible ranges of the signal curves in the trace chart after performing a zoom or scroll action, click the "undo zoom" icon on the toolbar. The following actions can be undone:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Zooming or scrolling with mouse wheel, touch functions, scrollbars of the trace chart, keyboard combinations or by drawing a rectangle</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Moving the trace diagram or individual signal curves by dragging and dropping;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using the zoom functions from the toolbar or from the context menu;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Arranging signals in tracks</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Scrolling the trace chart as a result of moving a measurement cursor to the edge of the visible range</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Changing the minimum or maximum Y values of signals in the signal table</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Automatic change of the visible range as a result of modifying the bit mask of a signal.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can undo a maximum of five actions. An action can be, for example, a single click on a zoom / scroll function button or context menu item. When you perform continuous actions, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Moving the trace diagram by dragging and dropping</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Continuously scrolling by keeping the mouse button pressed on a scroll bar</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The action has been completed when you release the mouse button.</p>
      <p>When you scroll the trace view by repeatedly pressing keyboard shortcuts in quick succession, or when you zoom in / out using the mouse wheel, the action is finished when the visible ranges of the signals do not change for at least 2 seconds.</p>
      <p>If you scroll the trace diagram by moving a measurement cursor, the "undo" function restores only the visible ranges of the signals. The positions of the cursors do not change.</p>
      <p>The "undo" history is cleared when you perform any of the following actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Add a new signal to the configuration</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Modify signal scaling groups</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Start a new trace recording</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Create a new trace session.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Deleting a signal from the configuration does not clear the "undo" history.</p>
