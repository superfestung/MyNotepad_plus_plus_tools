      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Overview</h3>
      <p>You have the option of deactivating system alarms in the TIA Portal for participants that no longer exist, e.g. DP slaves.</p>
      <p>You change the settings of the system alarms of the PLC (2.0xx.xxx) in the TIA Portal in the project navigation under "Shared data  > System diagnostic settings > General settings".</p>
      <p>Note that all changes are accepted for a complete alarm category – and not for an individual alarm.</p>
      <p>As soon as the appropriate alarm category is deactivated, it is no longer displayed as alarm/message in SINUMERIK Operate.</p>
      <p>The messages are still entered in the diagnostics buffer, independent of the setting.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Example</h3>
      <p>A DP slave was configured as default for your system; however, it no longer exists as participant, and is therefore deactivated by the user program with instruction D_ACT_DP.</p>
      <p>The following message is output in SINUMERIK Operate "Info: Deactivation of an I/O station - by the user".</p>
      <p>In order that the information message is no longer displayed, in the TIA Portal in the project navigation under "Shared data  > System diagnostic settings > General settings" deactivate the check box for alarm category "Info".</p>
      <p>The information message is deactivated. All of the alarms that belong to alarm category "Info" are no longer displayed.</p>
      <p>Additional information to configure the system diagnostics is provided in the TIA Portal documentation, keyword "System diagnostics for S7-1500 PLCs".</p>
