      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Introduction</h3>
      <p>You can save the following PLC security passwords in the "PLC Security" window. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Password to protect confidential PLC configuration data</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Access level password to protect the PLC against unauthorized access</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These PLC security passwords are configured in the TIA Portal. SINUMERIK Operate uses the PLC access level password to gain access to the PLC.</p>
      <p>SINUMERIK Operate does not directly require the password to protect confidential PLC configuration data. Nevertheless, it is recommended to store it in SINUMERIK Operate so that it can be restored via SINUMERIK Operate if a spare part is required. Otherwise, a TIA Portal is required for spare parts.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Access level password to protect the PLC against unauthorized access</h3>
      <p>The PLCs have different access levels to restrict access to certain functions, such as hardware configuration, PLC project, safety and access via S7 communication and blocks.</p>
      <p>The access levels of a PLC are configured <b>in the TIA Portal</b> in the PLC properties in the area "Protection & Security > Access level".</p>
      <p>
        <b>More information on this </b>topic is provided in the TIA Portal help under "Parameterizing access levels".</p>
      <p>The access level "Full access incl. fail-safe (no protection)" is required for the correct operation of SINUMERIK Operate. From PLC firmware 2.9, the default setting for the access level is "No access (complete protection)". When using this setting, you can assign a password for every access level. This prevents anybody from downloading the PLC project or overwriting it without knowing the passwords. The password is still required to communicate with the PLC via S7 communication.</p>
      <p>If a lower level than the "Full access incl. fail-safe (no protection)" access level has been set in the TIA Portal, the password for the "Full access incl. fail-safe (no protection)" access level must be made known in SINUMERIK Operate.</p>
      <p>Therefore, save the access level password for "Full access including fail-safe (no protection)" in SINUMERIK Operate under "Setup > Security > PLC Security > PLC access level password".</p>
      <p>Note that, in accordance with the product safety regulations, the access level password must be entered manually when restoring a PLC archive if the access level password has been set, even though it has been saved. The password only has to be entered if the safety component has changed and the access level is not machine manufacturer.</p>

        <b>Password to protect confidential PLC configuration data</b>
      </h3>
      <p>Proper functioning of certificate-based communication mechanisms for secure communication such as Secure PG/PC and HMI communication, Secure Open User Communication, HTTPS, Secure SMTP over TLS or OPC UA requires that the private keys used by these certificates are protected in the best possible way. As of CNC software V6.21, you can set up a user-defined password to protect these keys and other sensitive data: Password to protect confidential PLC-CPU configuration data.</p>
      <p>The password to protect confidential PLC configuration data is configured in the TIA Portal in PLC properties in area "Protection & Security > Protection of the PLC configuration data"; this allows confidential PLC configuration data to be encrypted on an individual basis for control systems.</p>
      <p>If the password is set in the TIA Portal for the PLC, this password must also be stored in the memory area of the internal PLC-CPU of the SINUMERIK. Otherwise the PLC cannot be set to RUN mode, it remains in STOP.</p>
      <p>The password is thus saved in the hardware, and is not contained in the project itself (load memory). </p>
      <p>You have the following options of setting the password in the NCU:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Setting the password via the TIA Portal </p>
          <p>
            <b>More information</b> on this topic is provided in the TIA Portal help under "Protection of confidential configuration data".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Setting the password via SINUMERIK Operate</p>
          <p>This is the only way that the password can subsequently be saved as a security component of a SINUMERIK archive and restored when this component is read in.</p>
