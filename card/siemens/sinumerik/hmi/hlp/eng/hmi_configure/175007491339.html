      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>You have edited an active trace session and recorded measured values.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Press the "Save trace" softkey.</p>
          <p>The "Save trace" dialog opens and offers the following save options.</p>

          </a> <img border="0" src="images/180755369227.png" width="400" height="143"/></li>
        <li>
          <p>Select the appropriate setting and press the "OK" softkey.</p>
          <p>The dialog for memory management opens and specifies the file name in the "Trace file name" input field. The file format is automatically specified as *.xml and cannot be changed.</p>
          <p>The target directory is "Trace", for example:</p>
          <p>Default path: <code>.../user/sinumerik/hmi/data/trace/</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Change the file name if you do not wish to use the existing name or wish to overwrite it.</p>
          <p>- or -</p>
          <p>Press the "Change folder" softkey if you wish to save the session file in a folder other than in the standard "Trace" folder.</p>
          <p>The data tree opens and you can select between the configured drives.</p>
          <p>- or -</p>
          <p>Press the "New directory" softkey if you wish to create a new directory.</p>
          <p>The "New directory" window opens in which you can assign a directory name.</p>
          <p>- or -</p>
          <p>Press the "Search" softkey to use dialog "Search file".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Click "OK" to confirm your entries and to save the session file.</p>
          <p>If the file name was changed and a session file with this name already exists, you will receive a corresponding confirmation prompt.</p>
