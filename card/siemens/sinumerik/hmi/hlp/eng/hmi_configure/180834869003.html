      <p>The following settings are synchronized between the trace widget and FFT widget:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Color, line width and line style of signal curves</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Background and grid colors of the diagram</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Configuration settings for the vertical scale such as scale positions and scale visibility</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you change the color or scale settings in the signal table or in the context menu, then the change applies to both the trace diagram and to the FFT diagram.</p>
      <p>Zooming and scrolling function independently in the two diagrams. However, some actions in the trace diagram e.g., moving the first two measurement cursors, cause the FFT diagram to be recalculated and re-displayed with default zoom ranges.</p>
      <p>The visibility of signal curves and the selected active signal can be controlled from the FFT legend widget, independently of the trace diagram.</p>
      <p>When the FFT widget is first opened for a trace configuration that contains bit signals, these signals will be automatically hidden in the FFT chart. They can be switched on using the visibility check boxes in the FFT legend.</p>
      <p>The FFT visualization settings (e.g., zoom range or signal visibility settings) are not saved in the trace session file.</p>
