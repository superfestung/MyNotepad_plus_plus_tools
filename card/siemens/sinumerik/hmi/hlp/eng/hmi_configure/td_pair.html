      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Introduction</h3>
      <p>If you want to pair an NCU with an IPC, you can use the "Pair NCU" dialog. </p>
      <p>Pairing is required to establish a relationship of trust between the IPC and NCU(s). This is necessary to use security functions in a distributed system because it enables protection of confidentiality and integrity in communication between the IPC and NCU. This makes misuse of data of the NCU simply by replacing the IPC impossible.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Requirement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>With active user management: You have the role "Security Admin" or access level 2 (service).<br />OR</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Without active user management: You have at least access level 3 (user).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The NCU that you want to pair with the IPC is in status "Pairing possible" The NCU to be paired must be <a href="td_status.html">configured correctly</a> beforehand for this purpose.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

            <ol class="action">
              <li>
                <p>In the "Setup" operating area, call the overview page for pairing with the softkeys "Security > Trusted devices".</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Select an NCU with the status "Pairing possible".</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Click "Pair NCU".</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The dialog with the date comparison of IPC and NCU opens. The date display of IPC and NCU must be synchronized because otherwise the generated certificates may be invalid. Confirm the dialog with "OK" if the data of the components are synchronized.<br />Alternatively, cancel the dialog and first synchronize the date settings for both devices before starting the dialog again. <br />You can set the date of the NCU in SINUMERIK Operate via "Setup > HMI > Date Time". <br />You can set the date of the IPC in the Windows system settings.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The data of the configured NCU opens. Confirm that you trust this NCU by verifying the displayed data (NCU name and serial number) and confirming with "OK".</p>

                <p>To complete pairing, you must enter the manufacturer password of the NCU to authenticate yourself as an authorized person and thus authorize the pairing on the NCU.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The selected NCU has now established a trusted connection with the IPC and you can use the security functions in the distributed system (IPC and NCU).</p>

          <p>On pairing, a pairing certificate was generated for the NCU. The pairing certificate of the NCU can be viewed on the overview page with "<a href="td_viewNCUcertificate.html">View certificate</a>". </p>
