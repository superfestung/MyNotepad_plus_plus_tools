      <p>The selected IPO clock cycle must be an integer multiple of the IPO basic clock cycle. The servo clock cycle must be an integer divisor of the same IPO basic clock cycle. The IPO basic clock cycle is determined from the machine data.</p>
      <p>The drop-down lists offer the most commonly used sampling rate values, calculated from the IPO basic clock cycle. You can also type a new value into the input fields (only valid values will be accepted).</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Sampling rate settings for drive trace</h3>
      <p>The selected sampling rate must be an integral multiple of the basic drive trace clock cycle, which is determined from machine data. The drop-down list offers the most commonly used values. You can also enter a new number into the input field (only valid values will be accepted).</p>
      <p>The "auto" setting means that the application will automatically calculate the fastest possible sampling rate. The number of drive parameters in the configuration and the time or capacity values in the trigger settings are taken into consideration.</p>
      <p>If you set both the recording time and the sampling rate to fixed values and the selected length of time (plus the pre-run time) cannot be recorded with the selected sampling rate, then an error will be output when you try to start the recording.</p>
