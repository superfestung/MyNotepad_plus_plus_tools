      <p>The "Arrangement in tracks" function can be used in the toolbar to display signals of the trace diagram in separate tracks. Only the visible signals are arranged.</p>
      <p>The binary signals are positioned in a group at the lower end of the trace diagram and their height is set to a pre-configured value.</p>
      <p>The non-binary signals are positioned above all the binary signals and their height is adjusted so that they fill the remaining space.</p>
      <p>If there are only binary signals or only non-binary signals, the height of the signal tracks is adjusted to fill the available space in the trace diagram.</p>
      <p>When the signal curves are rearranged, the signal names in the legend widget are also automatically re-arranged, so that their sequence matches the order of signal curves in the trace diagram.</p>
      <p>Each signal is arranged separately, even if the signals are grouped. As a result, the minimum or maximum vertical range values for signals in the same group is inconsistent. You can resolve this by entering a new minimum of maximum limit into the signal table.</p>
      <p>An error message is output if the vertical size of the trace diagram is not sufficient to display all signals with the configured minimum heights and clearances for the tracks.</p>
