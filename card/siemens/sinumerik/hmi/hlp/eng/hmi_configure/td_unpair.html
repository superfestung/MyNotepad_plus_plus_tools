      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Introduction</h3>
      <p>If you want to remove the relationship of trust between the IPC and NCU again, you can use the "Unpair NCU" dialog. </p>
      <p>The possible use cases for unpairing might be: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Replacement of an NCU if a spare part is required</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Accidental incorrect pairing</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Scrapping of a machine</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

            <p class="safety">As soon as you remove the relationship of trust between the IPC and NCU, secure communication between the two devices is no longer possible. </p>

              <li class="safety">
                <p class="safety">The user management on the NCU is deactivated as soon as you actively terminate the pairing. The user management on the IPC is still active.</p>

                <p class="safety">After unpairing, the access level passwords that were valid before activating the user management in the NCU are active again. Therefore <b>only</b> unpair the NCU from the IPC if you are sure that you know the old access level passwords.

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Requirement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>With active user management: You have the role "Security Admin" or access level 2 (service).<br />OR</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Without active user management: You have at least access level 3 (user).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>An NCU is in "Paired" status.</p>

              <li>
                <p>In the "Setup" operating area, call the overview page for pairing with the softkeys "Security > Trusted devices".</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Select an NCU with the status "Paired".</p>

              <li>
                <p>Click "Unpair NCU". A confirmation prompt appears indicating that secure communication is no longer possible between two devices and that user management will therefore be terminated. </p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>The user management is deactivated on the NCU. The previously defined passwords for the access levels of the SINUMERIK are valid again.</p>

          <p>No more security events of the NCU are signaled in the Security Eventlog.</p>
