      <p>The SINUMERIK user management differs from the classic system of access level management, and also offers numerous advantages - especially in the area of security:</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Differences compared to the previous authorization by means of access levels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Personalized login<br /></b>Every configured user can log in to the system in user management using his or her own user name and individual password. Since each user only knows his or her individual access data, this type of authorization is much more secure than authorization via access levels.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Configuring users, groups and roles</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The classic access levels of SINUMERIK (Manufacturer, Service, End User, etc.) are still available in the form of roles.  These roles can be assigned to users by the Security Admin in the form of user groups. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Introduction of two new roles:</b>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>There is a <b>Security Admin role for the manufacturer</b> and a <b>Security Admin role for the end user</b>.<br />The purpose of these two new roles is to separate the rights for security configuration from functional configuration.<br />These Security Admin roles are required to change security-relevant settings, but they have no functional rights (Key switch 0 role).<br />Nevertheless, it is possible to assign both a Security Admin role and a SINUMERIK function role (Manufacturer, Service, End User, etc.) to a user, so that a commissioning engineer can, for example, have the Security Admin role in addition to the Manufacturer role.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Another main advantage is that the security configuration on the end user side no longer needs to be changed, as it may be used by a larger number of people.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Key switch</b>: An anonymous login using the keyswitch is deactivated.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>PI service:</b> PI service for logging in/out and changing the password no longer works if user management is activated.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>For this purpose, there are new OA interfaces for login/logout/change password in user management.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Log in only from the paired IPC</b>: With user management activated, logging in from external HMIs - apart from the coupled IPC - is no longer possible. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Purpose and advantages of SINUMERIK user management</h3>
      <p>Activating the user management provides you with more security in user management and thus has numerous advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Protection of the system and data against unauthorized access (both internal and external)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Anonymous authorization methods, such as logging in via key switches, are no longer supported by the new user management. Each user authorizes himself uniquely via his domain, user name, and password</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Based on the support of a <b>central user management</b>, a central UMC server can be created, which controls the authorization of users that are already saved. This means that many users no longer have to be manually created.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Access management can be precisely controlled through the groups and roles. Roles can be assigned individually for each user. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Only a trained security administrator familiar with the subject matter can create new users, assign groups to users and role groups to their project. Other users cannot and do not have to deal with user management, which prevents misuse and reduces susceptibility to errors. Login information is thus better protected from publication and tampering.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Prompt blocking or deletion of users and authorizations when they are no longer needed (e.g. when a user leaves the company)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
