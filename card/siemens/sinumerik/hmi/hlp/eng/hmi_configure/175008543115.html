      <p>Menu items "Move" (drag the view) and "Zoom" in the main level of the context menu are mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p>If "Move" is selected, the basis mouse cursor has the shape of a hand. Using the hand-shaped cursor, click on an empty background area and drag this with the left-hand mouse key pressed: Shift the whole trace diagram, in the drag direction.</p>
      <p>If "Zoom" is selected, the basis mouse cursor is an arrow. Press the left mouse key on an empty background area and drag with the left mouse key pressed: Draw a "rectangle". When the mouse key is released, the diagram will be zoomed in to the area enclosed by the "rectangle".</p>
      <p>In both the "Move" and "Zoom" modes: Using the hand-shaped cursor, click on a signal line and drag this with the left mouse key pressed: Individually move the signal line. The other signals are not shifted and the active signal is not changed. </p>

Just the same as using the zoom direction symbols in the toolbar.</p><p>If horizontal zoom is selected, then the "Zoom the selected signal only" option is automatically disabled, since the horizontal axis is common for all signals.</p></li><li><p>Zoom only the selected signal (the selected signal group) or zoom all signals:</p><p>These two options are mutually exclusive. All zoom actions only influence the selected signal (the selected signal group) or influence all signals.</p></li></ul></div>
