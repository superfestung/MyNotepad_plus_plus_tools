      <p>You can create a signal group and assign signals. For signals of the same group, the same vertical axis scaling is applied, i.e. their minimum and maximum "Y-axis" values are identical.</p>
      <p>You can scale and shift assigned signals of a group together. This is useful when comparing signals of the same unit e.g. when comparing a setpoint value with an actual value.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Procedure</h3>
      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <ol class="action">
              <li>
                <p>If the signal table is not visible, open it using softkey "Signal table" or by clicking in the toolbar on the "Signal table" symbol.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Enter the name of the signal group into the "Signal group" column for the respective signal.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Click on the enter key or exit the field to confirm the selected signal group.</p>
                <p class="ImageClass">
                  <a id="image_173518430091_0">

              </li>
            </ol>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The scaling values of the signal group are applied to the signal curve if you are no longer in editing mode. If the signals are manually scaled or zoomed, all signals of the same group are scaled together.</p>
      <p>When a signal is removed from a group, its current scaling limits do not change.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Exception</h3>
      <p>Signals can be arranged in separate tracks above each other without any overlap with "Arrange in tracks".</p>
      <p>Signal groups are not considered. Each signal is arranged separately even if the signals are grouped. As a result, the minimum or maximum vertical range values for signals in the same group is inconsistent.</p>
      <p>When the vertical ranges for the signal values of the same group are inconsistent, you can resolve this by entering new minimum or maximum values for one of the signals. This again synchronizes the value ranges.</p>
      <p>When you use the zoom function &lt;CTRL+0> or "Show all", signals in the same group are scaled together, so that the minimum and maximum scaling limits of the group remain consistent.</p>
