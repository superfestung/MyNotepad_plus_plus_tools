      <p>The FFT diagram displays the Fast Fourier Transform for the measured signals that are currently displayed in the trace widget. The FFT widget can be opened and closed with an icon on the trace widget toolbar, or from the context menu in the trace widget. It can also be closed with the X icon on its window frame. The widget can be docked in the application window, or on a PC/IPC system, it can be used as a floating window.</p>
      <p>The horizontal axis of the FFT diagram shows the frequency range of the trace measurement. The upper frequency limit is calculated so that 0.5 is divided by the lowest sampling rate in the trace configuration.</p>
      <p>The vertical axis shows the amplitude of signals for the displayed frequencies. The result is scaled with the number of measurement points within the calculation range.</p>
      <p>If there are no measurement data in the trace widget, the FFT diagram is empty and displays only a message that no data are available. As soon as measurement data exist, FFT is automatically calculated and displayed.</p>
      <p>If the first two measurement cursors in the trace widget are switched on, then the FFT diagram is calculated only for the measuring range between the two cursors. This is indicated in the trace diagram so that the area outside the cursors is greyed out. When the measurement cursors are moved, FFT is dynamically recalculated.</p>
      <p>Whenever the FFT widget is switched on and becomes visible, it will automatically activate the first two measurement cursors in the trace diagram.</p>
      <p>If the first two measurement cursors in the trace diagram are switched off, FFT is calculated for the whole range of measured data.</p>
      <p>There is a lower and an upper limit to the measuring range for which FFT can be calculated. The difference between the cursor positions (or the entire measuring range if the cursors are switched off) must be between 0.01 and 1000 seconds. If the current range is outside these limits, the FFT diagram disappears and a warning is displayed in its place.</p>
      <p>When a trace recording is started with continuous visualization and measured data are displayed during the recording, then the FFT diagram is also continuously updated. The displayed results are calculated for the entire range of recorded data. Or, if a ring buffer is configured in the stop trigger settings, then for the contents of the ring buffer.</p>
