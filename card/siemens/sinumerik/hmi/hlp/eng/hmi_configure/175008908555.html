      <p>To change the line width, select a value from the drop-down list or enter a value in the field.</p>
      <p>The maximum line width is 20 pixels. There is also an "auto" setting for this purpose, which means that the trace widget will select the width according to the DPI value of the monitor.</p>
      <p>The line style can also be selected from a drop-down list. From the keyboard, the list can be opened by pressing the "Insert" key when the cursor is in the field.</p>
      <p>The settings for line width and line style apply to both the trace diagram and the FFT diagram.</p>
