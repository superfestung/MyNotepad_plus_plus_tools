      <p>SINUMERIK user management makes a distinction between three types of groups:</p>
      <a name="block_1">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Machine roles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Machine roles form a group for aggregating machine-level roles across multiple applications of the machine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Only the Security admin manufacturer can create, modify and delete machine roles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For each machine role, the manufacturer can decide whether it can be assigned by the end user.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Machine roles have the advantage that the manufacturer often has a better overview of all components of a SINUMERIK system and their implemented assignment of rights. The end user then no longer has to deal with the assignment of rights for the individual components. This is done by the manufacturer. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Machine roles inherit their function rights from one another. <br />Users inherit the AccessLevel from the machine roles to which they belong. A user who is assigned multiple machine roles receives the highest AccessLevel contained in these roles. A higher AccessLevel always also includes the lower access levels.<br />A machine role can also include the security administration role and transfer this role to the included user. The "Security admin manufacturer" role can only be held by users from the "Manufacturer" domain; the "Security admin end user" role can only be held by users that belong to the "end user" domain. This means that no user can have both Security Admin roles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the manufacturer domain is linked with a central user management, then machine roles (including the security admin manufacturer) are automatically assigned to user groups on the UMC server.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the user domain is linked with a central user management, then only the security admin end user role is automatically assigned.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <a name="block_2">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">User groups</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A user group is a group for the organizational grouping of users.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>There are local and central user groups.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Machine roles can be assigned to the user groups in SINUMERIK Operate.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <a name="block_3">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Users</h3>
      <p>A user can then in turn become a member of one or more user group(s). Via the user's login, the user management can assign which rights/roles which user has at any time. Only those functions are then accessible to the user that were previously defined in the machine role via user management.</p>
