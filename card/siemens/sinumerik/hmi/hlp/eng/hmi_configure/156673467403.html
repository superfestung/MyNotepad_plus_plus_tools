In conjunction with this, a logical grouping/structuring is introduced using the so-called channel groups. The desired NC channel can be directly selected using the selection menu. Without a channel menu, when pressing the channel switchover key, the NC channels must be scrolled through consecutively until the desired NC channel has been selected. An operator station can only be switched over across NCUs using the channel menu.</p></div>
