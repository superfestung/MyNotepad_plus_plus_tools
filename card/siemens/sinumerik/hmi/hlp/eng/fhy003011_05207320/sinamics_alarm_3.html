<td>For enabled SI monitoring integrated in the drive (p9601&#47;p9801 &gt; 0):<br />
- upgrade the firmware of the Control Unit to a later version.<br />
For enabled motion monitoring function (p9501 &gt; 0):<br />
- correct the monitoring clock cycle (p9500) and carry out POWER ON.<br />
For fault value = 100:<br />
- for S120M, set the actual value sensing clock cycle to p9511 = 0.<br />
For fault value = 101:<br />

- for motion monitoring functions integrated in the drive (p9601&#47;p9801bit 2 = 1) the actual value sensing clock cycle can be directly parameterized in p9511&#47;p9311.<br />
- SINAMICS S120M: set the monitoring clock cycle (p9500) to an integer multiple of 2 ms.<br />
For fault value = 104, 105:<br />
- set a separate actual value sensing clock cycle in p9511.<br />
- restrict operation to a maximum of two vector drives. For the standard setting in p0112, p0115, the current controller sampling time is automatically reduced to 250 &micro;s. If the standard values were changed, then the current controller sampling time (p0112, p0115) should be appropriately set.<br />
- increase the DP clock cycle for operation with an isochronous PROFIBUS so that there is a multiple clock cycle ratio of at least 4:1 between the DP clock cycle and the current controller sampling time. A clock cycle ratio of at least 8:1 is recommended.<br />
- With firmware version 2.5, please ensure that parameter p9510 is set to 1 in the drive (clock cycle synchronous operation).<br />
For fault value = 106:<br />
- set the parameters for the monitoring clock cycles the same (p10000 and p9500&#47;p9300).<br />
For fault value = 107:<br />
- set an actual value sensing clock cycle that matches the current controller clock cycle (p9511 &gt;= 4 * p0115[0], 8 * p0115[0]) is recommended.<br />
Note:<br />
An actual value sensing clock cycle (p9511) that is set too low, can sporadically mean that safety messages C01711&#47;C30711 are output with message value 1020 or 1021.<br />
For fault value = 108:<br />
- set a suitable actual value sensing clock cycle in p9511.<br />
- if the DP clock cycle is used as the actual value sensing clock cycle for operation with isochronous PROFIBUS (p9511 = 0), then a suitable DP clock cycle must be configured. This must be set to less than 8 ms. If this is not possible, then p9511 must be set to the required actual value sensing clock cycle (&lt; 8 ms).<br />
- For SIMOTION D410-2, a suitable multiple of the DP clock cycle (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10) must be parameterized. Otherwise, the clock cycle must be set to less than 8 ms.<br />
For fault value = 109:<br />
- set the actual value sensing clock cycle in p9511 to the same value as the current controller clock cycle (p0115[0]).<br />

For fault value = 110:<br />
- set the actual value sensing clock cycle in p9511 to 2 ms or higher.<br />
For fault value = 111:<br />
- set the monitoring clock cycle in p9500 as an integer multiple of the sampling time of the current controller (p0115[0]).<br />
For fault value = 112:<br />
- set the actual value sensing clock cycle p9511 to the required value (not equal to zero).<br />
For fault value = 200, 201:<br />
- increase the current controller sampling time (p0115[0]).<br />
- if required, reduce the number of components connected to the corresponding DRIVE-CLiQ line, or distribute the components across several DRIVE-CLiQ sockets.<br />
For fault value = 202:<br />
