      <p>In continuous-path mode, the tool travels across tangential contour transitions with as constant a path velocity as possible (no deceleration at block boundaries). LookAhead deceleration is applied before corners and blocks with exact stop.</p>

The smoothing clearance ADIS (or ADISPOS for G0) specifies the maximum extent to which corners can be smooth (rounded). Within this smoothing clearance, the control can ignore the configured path and replace it with a dynamically optimized path.</p><p>Disadvantage: Only one ADIS value is available for all axes.</p><p>The effect of G641 is similar to RNDM; however, it is not restricted to the axes of the working plane.</p><p>Just the same as G64, G641 works with lookahead predictive velocity control.
