      <p>The term "subprogram" has its origins during the time when part programs were split strictly into main and subprograms. Main programs were the part programs selected for processing on the control and then launched. Subprograms were the part programs called from within the main program.</p>
      <p>This strict division no longer exists with today's SINUMERIK NC language. In principle, each part program can be selected as a main program and launched or called from another part program as a subprogram.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the subprogram can then be used to refer to a part program called from within another part program. </p>
