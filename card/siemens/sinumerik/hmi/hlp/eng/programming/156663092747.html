The fully calculated NC blocks are then read into the control via postprocessors.</p><a name="block_1"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Programming the path curvature</h3><h4 class="Blocklabel">Surface description</h4><p>The path curvature is described by surface normal vectors with the following components:</p><p><code>A4, B4, C4 </code>Start vector at block start</p><p><code>A5, B5, C5</code> End vector at block end</p><p>If a block only contains the start vector, the surface normal vector will remain constant throughout the block. If a block only contains the end vector, interpolation will run from the end value of the previous block via large-circle interpolation to the programmed end value.</p><p>If the start and end vectors are programmed, interpolation runs between the two directions, also via large-circle interpolation. This allows continuously smooth paths to be created.</p><p>Regardless of the active G17 to G19 level, in the initial setting, surface normal vectors point in the Z direction.</p><p>The length of a vector is meaningless.</p><p>Vector components that have not been programmed are set to zero.</p><p>When ORIWKS is active (see "<a href="156663096715.html">Reference of the orientation axes (ORIWKS, ORIMKS):</a>"), the surface normal vectors refer to the active frame and are also rotated with frame rotation.</p><h4 class="Blocklabel">Machine manufacturer</h4><p>The surface normal vector must be perpendicular to the path tangent, within a limit value set via machine data, otherwise an alarm will be output.</p></div>
