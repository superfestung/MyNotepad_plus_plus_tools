      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Path and orientation</h4>
      <p>The type of circumferential milling used here is implemented by defining a path (guide line) and the associated orientation. In this type of machining, the shape of the tool on the path is not relevant. Only the radius at the tool intervention point is decisive.</p>

It should be applied if the programmed contour refers to the center-point path of a standard tool, and a tool other than a differential tool is used for machining. When calculating the 3D tool radius compensation, only the wear value of the radius of the active tool ($TC_DP15) and any programmed tool offsets OFFN and TOFFR/TOFFLR are taken into account. The basic radius ($TC_DP6) of the active tool is <b>not</b> taken into account.</p><h4 class="Blocklabel">Pocket milling with inclined side walls for circumferential milling with CUT3DC</h4><p>In this 3D tool radius compensation, a deviation of the mill radius is compensated by infeed toward the surface normals to be machined. The plane, in which the milling tool face is located, remains unchanged if the insertion depth ISD has remained the same. For example, a milling tool with a smaller radius than a standard tool would not reach the pocket base, which is also the limitation surface. For automatic tool infeed, this limitation surface must be known to the control, see Section "<a href="156663337227.html">3D circumferential milling taking into account a limitation surface (CUT3DCC, CUT3DCCD)</a>".</p><h4 class="Blocklabel">Advanced Surface / Top Surface</h4><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><font size="1px"></font></td></tr></table><table class="safety" border="1" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><colgroup><col width="5%"><col width="95%"></colgroup><tr><td><b>Note</b></td></tr><tr><td><p class="safety">When applying tool radius compensation CUT3DCD in combination with the "Advanced Surface" or "Top Surface" option (requiring a license), the setting recommendations regarding "Advanced Surface" / "Top Surface" must be observed.</p><p class="safety">A special test program is provided in the SIOS portal for checking the set data.</p><p class="safety">→ Test program for  </p></td></tr></table></div>
