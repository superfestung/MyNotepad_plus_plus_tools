      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Further information</h3>
      <p>If changes of orientation along the peripheral surface of a taper anywhere in space are to be described, the vector about which the tool orientation is to be rotated must be known. The start and end orientation must also be specified. The start orientation results from the previous block and the end orientation has to be programmed or defined via other conditions.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Programming in the ORIPLANE plane corresponds to ORIVECT</h4>
      <p>The programming of large-radius circular interpolation together with angle polynomials corresponds to the linear and polynomial interpolation of contours. The tool orientation is interpolated in a plane that is defined by the start and end orientation. If additional polynomials are programmed, the orientation vector can also be tilted out of the plane.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Programming of circles in a plane G2/G3, CIP and CT</h4>
      <p>The extended orientation corresponds to the interpolation of circles in a plane. For information about the programming options for circles with centerpoint data or radius data, such as G2/G3, circle via intermediate point CIP and tangential circles CT see Chapter "<a href="156661803275.html">Circular interpolation</a>".</p>

        <b>Interpolation of the orientation vector on the peripheral surface of a taper ORICONxx</b>
      </p>
      <p>Four different types of interpolation from G group 51 can be selected for interpolating orientations on the peripheral surface of a taper:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Interpolation on the outside of a taper in the clockwise direction ORICONCW with specification of end orientation and taper direction, or opening angle. The direction vector is programmed with identifiers A6, B6, C6 and the opening angle of the taper with identifier NUT= value range in interval 0 degrees to 180 degrees.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Interpolation on the outside of a taper in the counter-clockwise direction ORICONCCW with specification of end orientation and taper direction, or opening angle. The direction vector is programmed with identifiers A6, B6, C6 and the opening angle of the taper with identifier NUT= value range in interval 0 degrees to 180 degrees.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Interpolation on the outside of a taper ORICONIO with specification of end orientation and an intermediate orientation, which is programmed with identifiers A7, B7, C7.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Interpolation on the outside of a taper ORICONTO with tangential transition and specification of end orientation. The direction vector is programmed with identifiers A6, B6, C6.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
