      <p>If single axes are defined as punching/nibbling axes in addition to path axes, then the automatic path segmentation function can be activated for them. </p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Behavior of the single axis for SPP</h3>
      <p>The programmed path segment length (<code>SPP</code>) basically refers to the path axes. Therefore, in a block in which in addition to the single-axis movement and the SPP value no path axis has been programmed, then the SPP value is ignored.</p>
      <p>If both individual and path axes are programmed in the block, then the behavior of the single axis depends on the setting of the appropriate machine data.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Default setting</p>
          <p>The path traversed by the single axis is distributed evenly among the intermediate blocks generated by <code>SPP</code>.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>
        <code>N10 G1 SON X10 A0</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>N20 SPP=3 X25 A100</code>
      </p>
      <p>As a result of the stroke distance of 3 mm, for the total traversing distance of the X axis (path axis) of 15 mm, 5 blocks are generated. </p>
      <p>The A axis thus rotates through 20 degrees in every block.</p>
