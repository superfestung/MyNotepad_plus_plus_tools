      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Rise ramp</h4>
      <p>A rate of rise ramp for the new torque limit can be defined in MD to prevent any abrupt changes to the torque limit setting (e.g. insertion of a quill).</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Alarm suppression</h4>
      <p>The fixed stop alarm can be suppressed for applications by the part program by masking the alarm in a machine data item and activating the new MD setting with NEW_CONF.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Activation</h4>
      <p>The commands for travel to fixed stop can be called from synchronized actions or technology cycles. They can be activated without initiation of a motion, the torque is limited instantaneously. As soon as the axis is moved via a setpoint, the limit stop monitor is activated.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Activation from synchronized actions</h4>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>If the expected event ($R1) occurs and travel to fixed stop is not yet running, <code>FXS</code> should be activated for axis Y. The torque must correspond to 10% of the rated torque value. The width of the monitoring window is set to the default.</p>

In this operating state, an increase in the torque limit may result in sudden, jerky movements. To ensure that the axis can follow the setpoint, check the contour deviation to make sure it is not greater than the deviation with an unlimited torque.</p></li></ul></div>
