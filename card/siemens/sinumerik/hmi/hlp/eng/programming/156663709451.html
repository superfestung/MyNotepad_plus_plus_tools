      <p>The "Electronic gear" function allows you to control the movement of a <b>following axis</b> according to linear traversing block as a function of up to five <b>leading axes</b>. The relationship between each leading axis and the following axis is defined by the coupling factor.   </p>
      <p>The following axis motion part is calculated by an addition of the individual leading axis motion parts multiplied by their respective coupling factors. When an EG axis grouping is activated, it is possible to synchronize the following axes in relation to a defined position. A gear group can be: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Defined</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Activated</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Deactivated</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Deleted</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>The following axis movement can be optionally derived from</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Setpoints of the leading axes, as well as</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Actual values of leading axes.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Non-linear relationships between each leading axis and the following axis can also be realized as extension using <b>curve tables</b> (see "Path traversing behavior" section). Electronic gears can be cascaded, i.e., the following axis of an electronic gear can be the leading axis for a further electronic gear.</p>
