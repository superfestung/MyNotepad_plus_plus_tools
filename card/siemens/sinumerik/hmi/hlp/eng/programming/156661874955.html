      <p>If the address letter A appears in an NC block, either none, one or both of the axes in the active plane may also be programmed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Number of programmed axes</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If<b> no axis </b>of the active plane has been programmed, then this is either the first or second block of a contour definition consisting of two blocks.</p>
          <p>If it is the second block of such a contour definition, then this means that the starting point and end point in the active plane are identical. The contour definition is then at best a motion perpendicular to the active plane.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If<b> exactly one axis </b>of the active plane has been programmed, then this is either a single straight line whose end point can be clearly defined via the angle and programmed Cartesian coordinate or the second block of a contour definition consisting of two blocks. In the second case, the missing coordinate is set to the same as the last (modal) position reached.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If<b> two axes </b>of the active plane have been programmed, then this is the second block of a contour definition consisting of two blocks. If the current block has not been preceded by a block with angle programming without programmed axes of the active plane, then this block is not permitted.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Angle A may only be programmed for linear or spline interpolation.</p>
