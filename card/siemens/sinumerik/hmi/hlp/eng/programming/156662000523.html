        <b>G461</b>
      </p>
      <p>If no intersection is possible between the last TRC block and a preceding block, the offset curve of this block is extended with a circle whose center point lies at the end point of the uncorrected block and whose radius is equal to the tool radius.</p>
      <p>The control attempts to cut this circle with one of the preceding blocks.</p>

However, this behavior may be necessary if the part contour (as distinct from the programmed contour), to the left of N20 in the example, is not permitted to be violated even with y values greater than 10 mm.</p><p><b>Corner behavior with KONT</b></p><p>If KONT is active (travel round contour at start or end point), the behavior differs according to whether the end point is in front of or behind the contour.</p><ul><li><p><b>End point in front of contour</b></p><p>If the end point is in front of the contour, the retraction behavior is the same as with NORM. This property does not change even if the last contour block for G451 is extended with a straight line or a circle. Additional circumnavigation strategies to avoid a contour violation in the vicinity of the contour end point are therefore not required.</p></li><li><p><b>End point behind contour</b></p><p>If the end point is behind the contour, a circle or straight line is always inserted depending on G450/G451. In this case, G460-462 has no effect. If the last traversing block in this situation has no intersection with a preceding block, an intersection with the inserted contour element or with the straight line of the end point of the bypass circle to the programmed endpoint can result.<br />If the inserted contour element is a circle (G450), and this forms an interface with the preceding block, this is equal to the interface that would occur with NORM and G461. In general, however, a remaining section of the circle still has to be traversed. For the linear part of the retraction block, no further calculation of intersection is required.<br />In the second case, if no interface of the inserted contour element with the preceding blocks is found, the intersection between the retraction straight line and a preceding block is traversed.<br />Therefore, a behavior that deviates from G460 can only occur with active G461 or G462 either if NORM is active or the behavior with KONT is geometrically identical to that with NORM.</p></li></ul></div>
