        <b>Splines</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the case of splines, the tangential direction is defined by the straight line through the last two points. In the case of A and C splines with active ENAT or EAUTO, this direction is generally not the same as the direction at the end point of the spline.</p>
      <p>The transition of B splines is always tangential, the tangent direction is defined as for A or C splines and active ETAN.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Frame change</b>
      </p>
      <p>If a frame change takes place between the block that defines the tangent and the CT block, the tangent is also subjected to this change.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Limit case</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the extension of the start tangent runs through the end point, a straight line is produced instead of a circle (limit case: circle with infinite radius). In this special case, TURN must either not be programmed or the value must be TURN=0.</p>

            <p class="safety">When the values tend towards this limit case, circles with an unlimited radius are produced and machining with TURN unequal to 0 is generally aborted with an alarm due to violation of the software limits. </p>

        <b>Position of the circle plane</b>
      </p>
      <p>The position of the circle plane depends on the active plane (G17-G19).</p>
      <p>If the tangent of the previous block does not lie in the active plane, its projection into the active plane is used.</p>
      <p>If the start and end points do not have the same position components perpendicular to the active plane, a helix is produced instead of a circle.</p>
