        <b>AXTOCHAN in the NC program</b>
      </h4>
      <p>A <code>GET</code> is only executed in the event of the axis being requested for the NC program in the same channel (this means that the system waits for the state to actually change). If the axis is requested for another channel or is to become the neutral axis in the same channel, the request is sent accordingly.</p>

        <b>AXTOCHAN from a synchronized action</b>
      </h4>
      <p>In the event of an axis being requested for the same channel, <code>AXTOCHAN</code> from a synchronized action is mapped to a <code>GET</code> from a synchronized action. In this case, the axis becomes the neutral axis on the first request for the same channel. On the second request, the axis is assigned to the NC program in the same way as the GET request in the NC program. For more information about GET requests from a synchronized action, see "Motion-synchronous actions".</p>
