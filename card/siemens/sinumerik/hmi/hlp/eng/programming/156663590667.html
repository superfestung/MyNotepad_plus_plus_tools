        <b>Requirements for axis replacement</b>
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The axis must be defined in all channels that use the axis in the machine data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>It is necessary to define to which channel the axis will be assigned after POWER ON in the <b>axis</b>-specific machine data.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Description</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Release axis: RELEASE</b>
      </p>
      <p>When enabling the axis please note:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The axis must not be involved in a transformation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All the axes involved in an axis link (tangential control) must be enabled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A concurrent positioning axis cannot be replaced in this situation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All the following axes of a gantry master axis are transferred with the master.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With coupled axes (coupled motion, master value coupling, electronic gear) only the leading axis of the group can be enabled.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Accept axis: GET</b>
      </p>
      <p>The actual axis replacement is performed with this command. The channel for which the command is programmed takes full responsibility for the axis.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Effects of GET:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Axis replacement with synchronization:</p>
      <p>An axis always has to be synchronized if it has been assigned to another channel or the PLC in the meantime and has not been synchronized with "WAITP", G74 or delete distance-to-go before GET.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A preprocess stop occurs (as for STOPRE).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Execution is interrupted until the replacement has been completed.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Automatic "GET"</h4>
      <p>If an axis is in principle available in a channel but is not currently defined as a "channel axis", GET is executed automatically. If the axis/axes is/are already synchronized no preprocess stop is generated.</p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Setting the axis replacement behavior variably</h4>
      <p>The transfer point of axes can be set as follows using machine data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Automatic axis replacement between two channels then also takes place when the axis has been brought to a neutral state by WAITP (response as before)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When requesting an axis container rotation, all axes of the axis container which can be assigned to the executing channel are brought into the channel using implicit GET or GETD. A subsequent axle replacement is only permitted again once the axis container rotation has been completed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When an intermediate block is inserted in the main run, a check will be made to determine whether or not reorganization is required. Reorganization is only necessary if the axis states of this block do <b>not</b> match the current axis states.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Instead of a GET block with preprocess stop and synchronization between preprocessing and main run, axes can be replaced without a preprocess stop. In this case, an intermediate block is simply generated with the GET request. In the main run, when this block is executed, the system checks whether the states of the axes in the block match the actual axis states.</p>
