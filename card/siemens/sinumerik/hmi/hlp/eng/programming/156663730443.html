      <p>The FPR command can be used to specify the following axis of an electronic gear as the axis, which determines the revolutional feedrate. Please note the following with respect to this command:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The feedrate is determined by the setpoint velocity of the following axis of the electronic gear.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The setpoint velocity is calculated from the speeds of the leading spindles and modulo axes (which are not path axes) and from their associated coupling factors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Speed parts of linear or non-modulo leading axes and overlaid movement of the following axis are not taken into account.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
