        <b>Feedrate for thread cutting with G33</b>
      </p>
      <p>From the programmed spindle speed and the thread lead, the control calculates the required feedrate with which the turning tool is traversed over the thread length in the longitudinal and/or transverse direction. The feedrate <code>F</code> is not taken into account for <code>G33</code>, the limitation to maximum axis velocity (rapid traverse) is monitored by the control.</p>
