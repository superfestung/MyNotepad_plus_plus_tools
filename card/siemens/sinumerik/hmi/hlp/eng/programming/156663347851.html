      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Behavior at outer corners</h4>
      <p>A circle block with the radius of the cutter is always inserted at an outside corner.</p>
      <p>The <code>ORIC</code> and <code>ORID</code> program commands are used to determine whether changes in orientation programmed between block <code>N1</code> and <code>N2</code> are executed before the inserted circle block is processed or at the same time.</p>

The circle block generating the corner is inserted immediately before the second of the two traversing blocks.</p><p>If several orientation blocks are inserted at an external corner and <code>ORIC</code> is selected, the circular motion is distributed among the individual inserted blocks according to the absolute values of the orientation changes.</p><h4 class="Blocklabel">Smoothing orientation with OSD or OST</h4><p>When blending with <code>G642</code>, the maximum variance for the contour axes and orientation axes cannot vary greatly. The smaller tolerance of the two determines the type of smoothing motion and/or angular tolerance to smooth the orientation characteristic relatively strongly without having to accept higher contour deviations.</p><p><code>OSD</code> and <code>OST</code> can be activated to "generously" smooth very slight deviations from the orientation characteristics with a specified smoothing distance and angular tolerance without serious contour deviations.</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><font size="1px"></font></td></tr></table><table class="safety" border="1" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><colgroup><col width="5%"><col width="95%"></colgroup><tr><td><b>Note</b></td></tr><tr><td><p class="safety">Unlike the process of rounding the contour (and orientation characteristics) with <code>G642</code>, when rounding the orientation with <code>OSD</code> and/or <code>OST</code>, a separate block is not formed, instead the rounding movement is added directly to the programmed original blocks.</p><p class="safety">With <code>OSD</code> and/or <code>OST</code>, block transitions cannot be rounded if there is a change in the type of interpolation for tool orientation (vector → rotary axis, rotary axis → vector). These block transitions can if necessary be rounded with the standard rounding functions <code>G641</code>, <code>G642</code> and <code>G643</code>.</p></td></tr></table></div>
