      <p>Tool radius compensation is normally active before the compensation suppression and is still active when the compensation suppression is deactivated again. In the last traversing block before <code>CUTCONON</code>, the offset point in the block end point is approached. All following blocks in which offset suppression is active are traversed without offset. However, they are offset by the vector from the end point of the last offset block to its offset point. These blocks can have any type of interpolation (linear, circular, polynomial).</p>
      <p>The deactivation block of the compensation suppression, i.e. the block that contains <code>CUTCONOF</code>, is compensated normally. It starts in the offset point of the starting point. One linear block is inserted between the end point of the previous block, i.e. the last programmed traversing block with active <code> CUTCONON</code>, and this point.</p>
      <p>Circular blocks, for which the circle plane is perpendicular to the compensation plane (vertical circles), are treated as though they had <code>CUTCONON</code> programmed. This implicit activation of the offset suppression is automatically canceled in the first traversing block that contains a traversing motion in the offset plane and is not such a circle. Vertical circle in this sense can only occur during circumferential milling.</p>
