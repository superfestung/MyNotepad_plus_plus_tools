      <p>A transformation is activated by a function call in the NC program. Its parameters can be used to define both the orientation of the tool in space and the orientation movements of the rotary axes.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Orientation transformation </h3>
      <p>In the case of orientation transformations (three, four and five-axis transformations; TRAORI), the programmed position data always refer to the tip of the tool, which is tracked orthogonally to the machining surface in space. The Cartesian coordinates are converted from the basic coordinate system to the machine coordinate system and relate to the geometry axes. These describe the operating point. For the optimum machining of surfaces configured in space in the working area of the machine, machine tools require other axes in addition to the three linear axes X, Y and Z. The additional axes describe the orientation of the tool in space and are called orientation axes in subsequent sections. They are available as axes of rotation on four machine types with different kinematics:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Two-axis swivel head</p>
          <p>e.g. cardanic tool head with a rotary axis parallel to a linear axis with fixed tool table</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Two-axis rotary table</p>
          <p>e.g. fixed swivel head with tool table rotating about two axes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Single-axis swivel head and single-axis rotary table</p>
          <p>e.g. a rotatable swivel head with a rotated tool with the tool table rotating about an axis</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Two-axis swivel head and single-axis rotary table</p>
          <p>e.g. with a tool table that can rotate about an axis and a rotatable swivel head with a tool rotating about itself</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>3- and 4-axis transformations</b> are special types of 5-axis transformation and are programmed in the same way as 5-axis transformations.</p>
      <p>The functional scope of <b>generic 3/4/5/6-axis transformation</b> is suitable both for transformations for orthogonal rotary axes and for the cardanic milling head and, like all other orientation transformations, can also be activated for these four machine types with TRAORI. In the generic 5/6-axis transformation, the tool orientation has an additional third degree of freedom, in which the tool can be rotated around its own axis in space relative to the tool direction.</p>

      <p>
        <b>ORIRESET</b>
      </p>
      <p>If an orientation transformation is active using TRAORI, then ORIRESET can be used to specify the initial settings of up to 3 orientation axes with the optional parameters A, B, C. The programmed parameters are assigned to the rotary axes according to the order of the orientation axes determined by the transformation.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Kinematic transformation  </h3>
      <p>In the case of kinematic transformations (TRANSMIT, TRACYL, TRAANG), positions can be programmed in the Cartesian coordinate system. The control system transforms the programmed traversing movements of the Cartesian coordinate system to the traversing movements of the real machine axes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TRANSMIT and TRACYL</b>
      </p>
      <p>For milling on turning machines, the following machining types can be activated for the agreed transformation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Face machining in turning clamp with TRANSMIT</p>
          <p>→ Chapter "<a href="156663162123.html">Activating face end transformation (TRANSMIT)</a>"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Machining of arbitrarily running grooves on cylindrical bodies with TRACYL</p>
          <p>→ Chapter "<a href="156663165067.html">Activate cylinder surface transformation (TRACYL)</a>"</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>TRAANG</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the option of setting the infeed axis for inclined infeed is required, e.g. for grinding technology, TRAANG can be used to program a configurable angle for the transformation declared.</p>

      <p>→ Chapter "<a href="156663174923.html">Oblique plunge-cutting on grinding machines (G5, G7)</a>".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cartesian PTP travel</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kinematic transformation also includes "Cartesian PTP travel", for which up to 8 different articulated joint positions can be programmed. Although the positions are programmed in a Cartesian coordinate system, the movement of the machine occurs in the machine coordinates.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Concatenated transformation</h3>
      <p>Two transformations can be switched one after the other. For the second transformation chained here, the motion parts for the axes are taken from the first transformation.  </p>
      <p>The first transformation can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Orientation transformation TRAORI</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Polar transformation TRANSMIT</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cylinder transformation TRACYL</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Inclined axis transformation TRAANG</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The second transformation must be Inclined axis TRAANG.</p>
