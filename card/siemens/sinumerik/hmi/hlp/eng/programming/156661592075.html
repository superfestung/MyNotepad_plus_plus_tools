        <b>Travel with POSA</b>
      </p>
      <p>Block step enable or program execution is not affected by <code>POSA</code>. The movement to the end position can be performed during execution of subsequent NC blocks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Travel with POS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The next block is not executed until all axes programmed under <code>POS</code> reach their end positions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wait for end of travel with WAITP</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a <code>WAITP</code>, assignment of the axis to the NC program is no longer valid; this applies until the axis is programmed again. This axis can then be operated as a positioning axis through the PLC, or as a reciprocating axis from the NC program/PLC or HMI.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Block change in the braking ramp with IPOBRKA and WAITMC</b>
      </p>
      <p>An axis is only decelerated if the wait marker has not yet been reached or if another end-of-block criterion is preventing the block change. After a <code>WAITMC</code>, the axis starts immediately if no other end-of-block criterion is preventing the block change.</p>
