      <p>A main program can call subprograms which in turn call more subprograms. As such, the sequences of the programs are nested within each other. Each program runs on a dedicated program level.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Nesting depth</h3>
      <p>The NC language currently provides 16 program levels. The main program always runs at the uppermost program level, 0. A subprogram always runs at the next lowest program level following the call. Program level 1 is, therefore, the first subprogram level.</p>
      <p>Division of program levels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Program level 0: Main program level</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Program level 1 to 15: Subprogram level 1 to 15</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Interrupt routines (ASUB)</h3>
      <p>If a subprogram is called in the context of an interrupt routine, this will not be executed at the program level currently active in the channel (n) but at the next lowest program level (n+1). So that this remains possible even at the lowest program level, 2 additional program levels (16 and 17) are available in conjunction with interrupt routines.</p>
      <p>If more than 2 program levels are required, this has to be taken into account explicitly in the structuring of the part program executed in the channel. In other words, only a maximum of as many program levels may be used in order to leave sufficient program levels available for interrupt processing.</p>
      <p>If interrupt processing needs 4 program levels for example, the part program must be structured so that it uses a maximum of up to program level 13. In the event of an interrupt, the 4 program levels it requires (14 to 17) will be available to it.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Siemens cycles</h3>
      <p>Siemens cycles need 3 program levels. Therefore, a Siemens cycle must be called at the latest in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Part program processing: program level 12</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>interrupt routine: program level 14</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
