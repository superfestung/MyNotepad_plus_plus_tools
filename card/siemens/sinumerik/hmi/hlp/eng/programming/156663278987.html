      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Activation of modified setting data</h4>
      <p>When the setting data described above is modified, the tool components are not reevaluated until the next time a tool edge is selected. If a tool is already active and the data of this tool is to be reevaluated, the tool must be selected again.</p>
      <p>The same applies in the event that the resulting tool length is modified due to a change in the mirroring status of an axis. The tool must be selected again after the mirror command, in order to activate the modified tool-length components.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Orientable toolholders and new setting data</h4>
      <p>Setting data SD42900 to SD42940 has no effect on the components of an active toolholder with orientation capability. However, the calculation with an orientable toolholder always allows for a tool with its total resulting length (tool length + wear + tool base dimension). All modifications initiated by the setting data are included in the calculation of the resulting total length, i.e. vectors of the orientable toolholder are independent of the machining plane.</p>

            <p class="safety">When orientable toolholders are used, it is frequently practical to define all tools for a non-mirrored basic system, even those which are only used for mirrored machining. When machining with mirrored axes, the toolholder is then rotated such that the actual position of the tool is described correctly. All tool-length components then automatically act in the correct direction, dispensing with the need for control of individual component evaluation via setting data, depending on the mirroring status of individual axes.</p>

      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Further application options</h4>
      <p>The use of orientable toolholder functionality can also be useful if there is no physical option of turning tools on the machine, even though tools with different orientations are permanently installed. Tool dimensioning can then be performed uniformly in a basic orientation, where the dimensions relevant for machining are calculated according to the rotations of a virtual toolholder.</p>
