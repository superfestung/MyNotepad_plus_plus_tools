      <p>The extended stop and retract function - subsequently called ESR - offers the possibility of flexibly responding when a fault situation occurs as a function of the process: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Extended stop</b>
          </p>
          <p>Assuming that the specific fault situation permits it, all of the axes, enabled for extended stopping, are stopped in an orderly way.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Retraction</b>
          </p>
          <p>The tool currently in use is retracted from the workpiece as quickly as possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Generator operation (SINAMICS drive function "Vdc control")</b>
          </p>
          <p>If a parameterizable value of the DC-link voltage is fallen below, e.g. because the line voltage fails, the electrical energy required for retraction is generated by recovering the braking energy of the drive intended for this purpose (generator operation).</p>

      </ul>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Trigger sources</h3>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">General sources (NC-external/global or mode group-/channel-specific):</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Digital inputs (e.g. on NCU module) or the control-internal digital output image that can be read back ($A_IN, $A_OUT)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Channel state ($AC_STAT)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>VDI signals ($A_DBB)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Group messages of a number of alarms ($AC_ALARM_STAT)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Axial sources</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Emergency retraction threshold of the following axis (synchronism of electronic coupling, $VA_EG_SYNCDIFF[&lt;following axis>])</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Drive: DC-link warning threshold (imminent undervoltage), $AA_ESR_STAT[&lt;axis>]</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Drive: Generator minimum speed threshold (no further regenerative rotation energy available), $AA_ESR_STAT[&lt;axis>].</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Gating logic of the static synchronized actions: Source/response link</h3>
      <p>The static synchronized actions' flexible gating possibilities are used to trigger specific reactions relatively quickly according to the sources.</p>
      <p>Linking all relevant sources using static synchronized actions is the responsibility of the user. They can selectively evaluate the source system variables as a whole or by means of bit masks, and then make a logic operation with their desired reactions. The static synchronized actions are effective in all operating modes.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Activation</h3>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Function enable</h4>
      <p>The functions generator operation, shutdown, retraction are released by setting the corresponding control signal $AA_ESR_ENABLE. This control signal can be changed by synchronized actions.   </p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Function triggering</h4>
      <p>ESR is triggered jointly for all enabled axes by setting the system variable $AC_ESR_TRIGGER.   </p>
      <p>Generator operation is "automatically" activated in the drive when an imminent DC-link undervoltage is detected.</p>
      <p>Drive-independent stopping and/or retraction become active when a communication failure (between the NC and drive) is detected and when a DC-link undervoltage is detected in the drive (configuration and enable required). </p>
      <p>Drive-independent stopping and/or retraction can also be triggered by the NC by setting the appropriate control signal $AN_ESR_TRIGGER (broadcast command to all drives).   </p>
