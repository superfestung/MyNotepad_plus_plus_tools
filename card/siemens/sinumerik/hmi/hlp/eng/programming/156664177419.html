      <p>The current part program is calculated completely in the program simulation and the result is graphically displayed in the user interface. The result of programming is verified without traversing the machine axes. Incorrectly programmed machining steps are detected at an early stage and incorrect machining on the workpiece prevented.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Simulation NC</h3>
      <p>The simulation uses its own NC instance (simulation NC). Therefore, before a simulation is started, the real NC must be aligned to the simulation NC. With this alignment, all active machine data is read out of the NC and read into the simulation NC. The NC and cycle machine data is included in the active machine data.</p>
