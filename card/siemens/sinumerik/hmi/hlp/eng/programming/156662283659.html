      <p>Command axes are started from synchronized actions in response to an event (command). They can be positioned, started and stopped fully asynchronous to the part program. An axis cannot be moved from the part program and from synchronized actions simultaneously.   </p>
      <p>Command axes are interpolated separately; in other words, each command axis has its own axis interpolator and its own feedrate.</p>
