      <h4 class="Blocklabel">G75</h4>
      <p>The axes are traversed as machine axes in rapid traverse. The motion is mapped internally using the "SUPA" (suppress all frames) and "G0 RTLIOF" (rapid traverse motion with single-axis interpolation) functions.</p>
      <p>If the conditions for "RTLIOF" (single-axis interpolation) are not met, the fixed point is approached as a path.</p>
      <p>When the fixed point is reached, the axes come to a standstill within the "Exact stop fine" tolerance window.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Parameterizable dynamic response for G75</h4>
      <p>The required dynamic response mode can be set via the following machine data for positioning movements to fixed-point positions (G75): </p>
      <p>MD18960 $MN_POS_DYN_MODE (type of positioning axis dynamic response)</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Additional axis movements</h4>
      <p>The following additional axis movements are taken into account at the instant in time at which the G75 block is interpreted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>External work offset</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>DRF</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Synchronization offset ($AA_OFF)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>After this, the additional axis movements are not permitted to change until the end of traversing is reached by the G75 block.</p>
      <p>Additional motion following interpretation of the G75 block will offset the approach to the fixed point accordingly.</p>
      <p>The following additional movements are not taken into account, irrespective of the point at which interpolation takes place, and will offset the target position accordingly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Online tool offset</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Additional movements from compile cycles in the BCS and machine coordinate system</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Active frames</h4>
      <p>All active frames are ignored. Traversing is performed in the machine coordinate system.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Working area limitation in the workpiece coordinate system/SZS</h4>
      <p>Coordinate-system-specific working area limitation (WALCS0 ... WALCS10) is not effective in the block with G75. The destination point is monitored as the starting point of the following block.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Axis/Spindle movements with POSA/SPOSA</h4>
      <p>If programmed axes/spindles were previously traversed with POSA or SPOSA, these movements will be completed first before the fixed point is approached.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Spindle functions in the G75 block</h4>
      <p>If the spindle is excluded from "fixed-point approach", then additional spindle functions (e.g. positioning with SPOS/SPOSA) can be programmed in the G75 block.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Modulo axes</h4>
      <p>In the case of modulo axes, the fixed point is approached along the shortest distance.</p>
