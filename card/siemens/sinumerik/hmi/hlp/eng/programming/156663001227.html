      <p>Settable frames or basic frames can be read and written via the part program and via the OPI by the operator and by the PLC. </p>
      <p>The fine offset can also be used for global frames. Global frames are suppressed in the same way as channel-specific frames, via G53, G153, SUPA and G500.</p>

      <p>The number of basic frames can be configured in the channel via the machine data MD28081 $MC_MM_NUM_BASE_FRAMES. The standard configuration is designed for at least one basic frame per channel. A maximum of eight basic frames are supported per channel. In addition to the eight basic frames, there can also be eight NCU global basic frames in the channel.   </p>

      <h4 class="Blocklabel">$P_CHBFR[n]</h4>
      <p>System variable $P_CHBFR[n] can be used to read and write the basic frames. When a basic frame is written, the chained total basic frame is not activated until the execution of a G500, G54 ... G599 statement. The variable is used primarily for storing write operations to the basic frame on HMI or PLC. These frame variables are saved by the data backup.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">First basic frame in the channel</h4>
      <p>The basic frame with array index 0 is not activated simultaneously when writing to the predefined $P_UBFR variable, but rather activation only takes place on execution of a G500, G54 ... G599 statement. The variable can also be read and written in the program.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">$P_UBFR</h4>
      <p>$P_UBFR is identical to $P_CHBFR[0]. One basic frame always exists in the channel by default, so that the system variable is compatible with older versions. If there is no channel-specific basic frame, an alarm is issued at read/write: "Frame: statement not permissible".</p>
