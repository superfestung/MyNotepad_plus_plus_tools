      <p>Using the predefined SEATRAON procedure, users can reactivate the last transformation that was deselected after a block search.</p>
      <p>The following transformations are taken into consideration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Classic transformations: TRANSMIT, TRACYL and TRAORI</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Transformations based on the kinematic chain: TRANSMIT_K, TRACYL_K, TRAORI_STAT, TRAORI_DYN, TRAINT</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The call is only permissible in the automatically activated PROG-EVENT program ($P_PROG_EVENT==5) in the area for the block search.</p>
      <a name="block_1">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Application</h3>
      <p>If the basic setting to reactivate the transformation is active (MD52212 $MCS_FUNCTION_MASK_TECH, Bit 19 = 0), then the last deselected transformation is automatically reactivated at the beginning of the PROG_EVENT program.</p>
      <p>However, if spindle programs for a block search are collected and only output at a later point in time, e.g. because the output of help functions is suppressed in the action blocks (MD11450 SEARCH_RUN_MODE, Bit 2 = 1), then the transformation must also be reactivated at a later point in time. Otherwise, a conflict can occur between the spindle axis and the transformation axis</p>
      <p>In this or in similar cases, by appropriately programming SEATRAON, users must ensure that the transformation is reactivated at the correct point in time. In the case described, i.e. after handling the spindle.</p>

      <p>SEATRAON must be located alone in the block:</p>
