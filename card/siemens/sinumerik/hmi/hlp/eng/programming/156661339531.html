      <p>The basic coordinate system (BCS) consists of three mutually perpendicular axes (geometry axes) as well as other special axes, which are not interrelated geometrically.     </p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Machine tools without kinematics transformation</h3>
      <p>BCS and MCS always coincide when the BCS can be mapped onto the MCS without kinematics transformation (e.g. 5-axis transformation, TRANSMIT/TRACYL/TRAANG).</p>
      <p>On such machines, machine axes and geometry axes can have the same names.</p>

However, such workpieces are being programmed ever more frequently on machine tools with rotary axes or linear axes not perpendicular to one another. Kinematic transformation is used to represent coordinates programmed in the workpiece coordinate system (rectangular) in real machine axis motion.</p></div>
