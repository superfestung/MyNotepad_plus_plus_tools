      <p>At the start of the thread, a distinction is made between thread lead (parameter LW) and thread run-in (parameter LW2).</p>
      <p>If you program a thread lead, the programmed starting point is moved forward by this amount. You use the thread lead if the thread starts outside the material, for example, on the shoulder of a turned part.</p>
      <p>If you program a thread run-in, an additional thread block is generated internally in the cycle. The thread block is inserted in front of the actual thread on which the tool is inserted. You require thread run-in if you want to cut a thread on the middle of a shaft.</p>
      <p>If you program a thread run-out > 0, an additional thread block is generated at the end of the thread. If a thread run-out is not programmed, it is advantageous to first machine a thread undercut.</p>

            <p class="safety">The parameters thread run-in (LW2) and thread run-out (LR) used in the cycles have a purely geometrical meaning. They do not influence the dynamic response of the thread blocks. The parameters result internally in a concatenation of several thread blocks.</p>
