          <p>Drilling depth</p>
          <p>Depending on the selection of the drill shank or drill tip or the centering diameter, the programmed drilling depth refers to the following for cycles with a selection field:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Tip (drilling depth in relation to the tip)</p>
              <p>The drill is inserted into the workpiece until the drill tip reaches the value programmed for Z1.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Shank (drilling depth in relation to the shank)</p>
              <p>The drill is inserted into the workpiece until the drill shank reaches the value programmed for Z1. The angle entered in the tool list is taken into account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Diameter (centering in relation to the diameter, only for CYCLE81)</p>
              <p>The diameter of the centering hole is programmed at Z1. In this case, the tip angle of the tool must be specified in the tool list. The drill is inserted into the workpiece until the specified diameter is reached.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Drilling positions</h3>
      <p>The cycle assumes the tested hole coordinates of the plane.</p>
      <p>The hole centers should therefore be programmed before or after the cycle call as follows (see also Section, Cycles on single position or position pattern (MCALL)):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A single position should be programmed before the cycle call</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Position patterns (MCALL) should be programmed after the cycle call</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>as drilling pattern cycle (line, circle, etc.) or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>as a sequence of positioning blocks for the hole centers</p>
