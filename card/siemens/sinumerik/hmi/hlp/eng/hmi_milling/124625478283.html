      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Within a position pattern, or while approaching the next position pattern, the tool is retracted to the retraction plane and the new position or position pattern is then approached at rapid traverse.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With subsequent technological operations (e.g. centering - drilling - tapping), the respective drilling cycle must be programmed after calling the next tool (e.g. drill) and immediately afterwards the call of the position pattern to be machined.</p>

          <p>The programmed positions are machined with the previously programmed tool (e.g. center drill). Machining of the positions always starts at the reference point. In the case of a grid, machining is performed first in the direction of the 1st axis and then meandering back and forth. The frame and circle or pitch circle are machined counter-clockwise.</p>

          <p>G code</p>
          <p>For G code, for rows/frames/grids, a start is always made at the next corner of the frame or grid or the end of the row. The frame and circle or pitch circle are machined counter-clockwise.</p>
