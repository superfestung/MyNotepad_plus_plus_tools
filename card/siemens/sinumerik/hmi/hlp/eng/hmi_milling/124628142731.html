      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Standard log<br />Output of the measurement results from the automatic measuring cycles in a log file.<br />Each measuring method of the standard measuring cycles is assigned a fixed standard log with regard to the contents. The contents correspond to the measurement result display on the screen. User entries for the log contents are not required.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>User log<br />Output of user-relevant data as a separate log or supplement to the measurement log.<br />The contents and format are the sole responsibility of the user. A predefined variable field is available which can take the contents of the log.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is possible to log to external media, if they are available, on local drives, USB or in the part program memory. The log output can be in text format or in tabular format (column separator ";") for further processing in spreadsheet programs.</p>
      <p>The decimal places of the measurement results in the protocol depend on the respective display accuracies set in the control system.</p>

      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Requirements</h3>
      <p>If the data is to be saved to external media, such as USB or network drives, then the "EES" option is required (see "Commissioning Manual Sinumerik Operate (IM9)").</p>

      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Contents of a standard log</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Date/time (when the log was written), log name with path</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Measuring method</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The most important input values (that were entered in the screen form before measuring)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Correction target</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Setpoints, measured values and differences </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As many decimal places are logged as displayed on the screen. The terms and axis identifiers also correspond to those displayed on the screen – but are written out (without abbreviations). The measurement unit mm/inch depends on the system of units active during the measurement.</p>
