      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Block search</h3>
      <p>If during the block search, a cycle call for logging "On" is executed, this state is saved. The following measuring cycle calls that are run through in the block search mode do not log anything (because there are no measuring results). Logging is started as of the program start when the search target is reached.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the state is also saved for a cycle call for logging "Off" during the block search, and then nothing logged as of the program start.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Simulation</h3>
      <p>The following behavior applies in the simulation of Operate:</p>
      <p>Programs with calls for the logging function can be executed, but no logs are created.</p>
      <p>During simulation, measuring cycles do not return any measurement results, they only show the traversing to the measuring points – and therefore there is nothing to log.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Several channels</h3>
      <p>In principle, measuring programs with logging can run in two channels.</p>
      <p>However, the user must ensure that the measuring and logging functions run in succession from channel to channel and do not overlap. This also applies to user logs.</p>
