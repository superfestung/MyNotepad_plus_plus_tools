      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>This measuring variant can be used to measure a groove in a workpiece. The groove width is measured and the groove center point determined. Measurements at an inclined groove are also possible. To do this, an angle corresponding to the actual angularity of the groove position should be entered into the parameterizing screen form. Probing at the groove edge always takes place at right angles. A protection zone can be defined in the groove.</p>
      <p>With the "3D probe with spindle reversal" measuring method, measurement is performed in the axes of the plane as differential measurement. Two complete measurements of the groove are automatically carried out one after the other, one with a spindle position of 180 degrees, and one with 0 degrees. The special procedure for this measurement permits the use of an uncalibrated multi-directional probe. However, the correct tool radius of the probe must be determined once by calibrating the probe. Probe types 712, 713 and 714 are not suitable for this purpose. A positionable spindle is mandatory.</p>
      <p>With the "Align 3D probe" measuring method, the switching direction of the probe is always aligned to the current measuring direction. This function is recommended when high demands are placed on the measuring accuracy. Probe types 712, 713 and 714 are not suitable for this purpose. A positionable spindle is mandatory.</p>
      <p>The measurement result (measurement difference) can be used for the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Correction of a WO so that the workpiece zero is in relation to the groove center point</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Offset of a tool</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Measurement without offset</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>An extended tool offset in the replacement tools as well as additive and setup offsets are also possible. Empirical values can generally be included in the calculations for tool offsets.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>One point at each of the opposite edges of the slot are measured based on the selected measuring axis. The positive direction of the geometry axis is measured first.</p>
      <p>From the two actual positions, taking into account the calibration values, the groove width is calculated.</p>
      <p>The position of the groove center as workpiece zero is determined according to the work offset selected to be corrected.</p>
      <p>With the selection Setpoint center point "YES", the position of the groove center can be defined as workpiece zero through setpoint specifications.</p>
      <p>The measured difference of the groove width is used as basic variable for a tool offset, the position of groove zero point, as basis of a work offset.</p>
