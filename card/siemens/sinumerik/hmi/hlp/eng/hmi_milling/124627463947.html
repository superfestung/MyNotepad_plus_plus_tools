      <p>The workpiece lies in any direction, i.e. not parallel to the workpiece coordinate system (WCS) on the work table. By measuring two points on the workpiece reference edge that you have selected, you determine the angle to the active coordinate system. You can correct this angle as a rotation either in a geometry axis or as translatory offset in a rotary axis (rotary table) in any WO or in the active WO.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The Align edge measuring variant is performed according to the 1-angle measurement principle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>For a clamped workpiece that is rotated in the plane, the angular offset is in the rotary part of the geometry axis that is located perpendicular to the measuring plane.</p>
          <p>Example of G17 plane: Measuring axis X, offset axis Y</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Angular offset is realized in the Z rotation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The rotation offset in the WO is performed so that the actual position of the edge (actual value) and the desired setpoint angle (α) in the workpiece coordinate system must be taken into account.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For a workpiece on a rotary table, the angular offset is added to the translatory offset of the rotary axis (table axis). The correction only makes sense if the rotary axis rotates around the geometry axis that is located perpendicular to the measuring plane.</p>
          <p>Example of G17 plane: Measuring axis X, offset axis Y </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Angular offset is realized in the C axis. Rotary axis C rotates a rotary table around the Z axis.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>After the measurement, the rotary axis should be repositioned to align the workpiece.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Example: G55 G0 C0.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For both correction variants, the translatory components of the WO remain unchanged and should be redetermined after the edge has been aligned. This can be realized in a subsequent measuring program using the function "Set edge".</p>

This means that the trigger points for the corresponding axis direction are currently being newly determined for this measurement (it is not necessary to calibrate the probe in the measuring direction).
