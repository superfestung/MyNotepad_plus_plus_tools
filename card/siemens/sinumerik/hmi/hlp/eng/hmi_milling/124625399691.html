      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Predrilling</h3>
      <p>For predrilling, the reduced feedrate (FA) is used up to the predrilling depth (ZA) and then the drilling feedrate is used. For drilling with several infeed steps, the predrilling depth must be between the reference point and the 1st drilling depth.</p>
      <a name="block_3">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Through drilling </h3>
      <p>For a through-hole, starting from the remaining drilling depth (ZD), a reduced feedrate (FD) is used.</p>
      <a name="block_4">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Pilot hole</h3>
      <p>The cycle optionally takes into account the depth of a pilot hole. This can be programmed with abs/inc – or a multiple of the hole diameter (1.5 to 5*D is typical, for example) – and is assumed that it is available. </p>
      <p>If a pilot hole exists, the 1st drilling depth must be between the pilot hole and the final drilling depth. The tool enters the pilot hole with reduced feedrate and reduced speed; these values can be programmed. </p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Direction of spindle rotation</h4>
      <p>The direction of spindle rotation with which the tool enters and withdraws from the pilot hole can be programmed as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>with stationary spindle</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>with clockwise rotating spindle</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>with counterclockwise rotating spindle</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This avoids long or thin drills from being broken.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Horizontal drilling</h4>
      <p>For horizontal drilling using spiral drills, entering the pilot hole is improved if the cutting edges of the drill are also in the horizontal position. To support this, the alignment of the drill in the spindle can be programmed for a specific position (SPOS).</p>
      <p>The feedrate is stopped before reaching the pilot hole depth, the speed increased to the drilling speed and the coolant switched in.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Soft first cut into the material</h3>
      <p>The entry into the material can be influenced, depending on the tool and the material. </p>
      <p>The soft first cut comprises two partial distances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The first cut feedrate is maintained to a programmable first feed distance ZS1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>An additional programmable feed distance ZS2 immediately following ZS1 is used to continuously increase the first cut feedrate (with FLIN) to the drilling feedrate.  </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>With chip breaking / swarf removal, this mechanism takes effect at each infeed.</p>
      <p>The input parameters ZS1 and ZS2 are maximum values that are limited by the cycle to the infeed depth to be executed.</p>
