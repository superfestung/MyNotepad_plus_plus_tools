      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Approaching a machining operation</h3>
      <p>When approaching the programmed machining operation in the swiveled plane, under worst case conditions, the software limit switches could be violated. In this case, the system travels along the software limit switches above the retraction plane. In the event of violation below the retraction plane, for safety reasons, the program is interrupted with an alarm. To avoid this, before swiveling, e.g. move the tool in the X/Y plane and position it as close as possible to the starting point of the machining operation or define the retraction plane closer to the workpiece.</p>
