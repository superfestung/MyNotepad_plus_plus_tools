      <p>With this measuring version, the tool length (L1 and/or L2) of a turning tool with cutting edge positions 1 to 8 can be determined. The measuring version checks whether the difference to be corrected with respect to the old tool length lies within a defined tolerance range:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Upper limits: Safe area TSA and dimensional difference control DIF</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Lower limit: Work offset range TZL</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If this range is not violated, the new tool length is accepted in the tool offset, otherwise an alarm is output. Violation of the lower limit is not corrected.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>For "complete" measuring, all lengths of a turning tool are measured:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Turning tool with cutting edge positions 1 to 4: L1 and L2</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Turning tool with cutting edge position 5 or 7: L2</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Turning tool with cutting edge position 6 or 8: L1</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the turning tool has a cutting edge position 1 to 4, contact is made with the probe in both axes of the plane (for G18 Z and X), whereby the measurement starts with the 1st axis of the plane (for G18, Z). For cutting edge positions 5 to 8, a measurement is only performed in one axis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Cutting edge position 5 or 7: 1. measuring axis for G18 Z</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cutting edge position 6 or 8: 2. measuring axis for G18 X.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>When measuring "axis by axis", the length of the turning tool in the parameterized measuring axis is measured.</p>
