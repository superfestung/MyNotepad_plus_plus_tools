          <p>The tool moves to the starting point calculated internally in the cycle at rapid traverse.</p>

          <p>Thread with advance:</p>
          <p>The tool moves at rapid traverse to the first starting position displaced by the thread advance LW.</p>
          <p>Thread with run-in:</p>
          <p>The tool moves at rapid traverse to the starting position displaced by the thread run-in LW2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The first cut is made with thread pitch P as far as the thread run-out LR.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Thread with advance:</p>
          <p>The tool moves at rapid traverse to the return distance VR and then to the next starting position.</p>
          <p>Thread with run-in:</p>
          <p>The tool moves at rapid traverse to the return distance VR and then back to the starting position.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the thread is finished.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool moves back to the retraction plane at rapid traverse.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thread machining can be stopped at any time with the "Rapid lift" function. It ensures that the tool does not damage the thread when it is raised.</p>
