      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>This measuring variant can be used to measure a rectangular pocket in a workpiece. The pocket width and the pocket length are measured and the pocket center point is determined.</p>
      <p>The measurements are always performed parallel to the geometry axis of the active plane. Measurements are also possible at a rectangular pocket rotated around the infeed axis. To do this, an angle corresponding to the real pocket position must be entered into the parameterization screen form. Probing at the sides of the pocket is always at right angles to these. A protection zone can be defined in the pocket.</p>
      <p>With the "3D probe with spindle reversal" measuring method, measurement is performed in the axes of the plane as differential measurement. Two complete measurements of the rectangular pocket are automatically carried out one after the other, one with a spindle position of 180 degrees, and one with 0 degrees. The special procedure for this measurement permits the use of an uncalibrated multi-directional probe. However, the correct tool radius of the probe must be determined once by calibrating the probe. Probe types 712, 713 and 714 are not suitable for this purpose. A positionable spindle is mandatory.</p>
      <p>With the "Align 3D probe" measuring method, the switching direction of the probe is always aligned to the current measuring direction. This function is recommended when high demands are placed on the measuring accuracy. Probe types 712, 713 and 714 are not suitable for this purpose. A positionable spindle is mandatory.</p>
      <p>The measurement result (measurement difference) can be used for the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Correction of a WO so that the workpiece zero is in relation to the center point of the rectangle</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Offset of a tool</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Measurement without offset</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>An extended tool offset in the replacement tools as well as additive and setup offsets are also possible. Empirical values can generally be included in the calculations for tool offsets.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>Two opposite points in each of the two geometry axes of the plane are measured. The measurements start in the positive direction of the 1st geometry axis. From the four measured actual positions of the pocket sides, the pocket width and the pocket length are calculated, taking into account the calibration values. The position of the pocket center as workpiece zero is determined corresponding to the work offset selected to be corrected. The measuring differences of the side lengths are used as the basic quantity for a tool offset, the position of the pocket zero point as basis for the work offset.</p>
      <p>With the selection Setpoint center point "YES", the position of the rectangular pocket center can be defined as workpiece zero through setpoint specifications.</p>
