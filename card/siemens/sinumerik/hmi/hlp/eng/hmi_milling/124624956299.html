      <p>Each input screen has a selection box for the planes, if the planes have not been specified by NC machine data.  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Empty (for compatibility reasons to screen forms without plane)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>G17 (XY)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>G18 (ZX)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>G19 (YZ)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are parameters in the cycle screens whose names depend on this plane setting. These are usually parameters that refer to positions of the axes, such as reference point of a position pattern in the plane or depth specification when drilling in the tool axis. </p>
      <p>For G17, reference points in the plane are called X0 Y0, for G18 they are called Z0 X0 - and for G19, they are called Y0 Z0. The depth specification in the tool axis for G17 is called Z1, for G18, Y1 and for G19, X1. </p>
      <p>If the entry field remains empty, the parameters, the help screens and the broken-line graphics are displayed in the default plane (can be set via machine data): </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Turning: G18 (ZX) </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Milling: G17 (XY) </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The plane is transferred to the cycles as new parameter. The plane is output in the cycle, i.e. the cycle runs in the entered plane. It is also possible to leave the plane fields empty and thus create a plane-independent program.</p>
      <p>The entered plane only applies for this cycle (not modal)! At the end of the cycle, the plane from the main program applies again. In this way, a new cycle can be inserted in a program without having to change the plane for the remaining program.</p>
