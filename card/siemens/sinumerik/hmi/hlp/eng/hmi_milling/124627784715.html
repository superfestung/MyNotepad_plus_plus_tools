      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>With this measuring method the angularity of a spindle to the machine tool is measured on a calibration ball. The measurement is carried out by combining the measuring methods "sphere" (CYCLE997) and "outer circle segment" (CYCLE979).</p>
      <p>Based on the measured values, the angular deviation of the spindle to the axis of the plane is calculated.</p>
      <p>With the measured angular deviations, the spindle can be mechanically aligned parallel to the tool axis or the corresponding tables for sag compensation can be updated.</p>
      <p>If there are rotary axes, the determined angular data can be used to align the rotary axis. To do this, the result parameter (_OVR) of CYCLE995 must be used.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The 1st measurement of the calibration ball is performed with CYCLE997 and measurement is repeated. The starting angle can be freely selected. The incremental angle between the measuring points should be set to 90 degrees. From two measuring points along the circumference and one measuring point at the "north pole" of the sphere (highest point), the center point (position of the ball) is determined. In addition, the diameter of the calibration ball can be determined.</p>
      <p>The 2nd measurement is performed with CYCLE979 at the shank of the probe at a distance of DZ. The starting angle and the incremental angle are taken from the 1st measurement. The measuring path and the safe area are also from the 1st measurement times a factor of 1.5. The center point of the probe shaft in the plane is determined.</p>
      <p>For both measurements, the switching direction of the probe is corrected for each individual measurement.</p>
      <p>The angular deviation in XY is calculated from the results of the two center points in XY and the distance between the two measurements in Z (for G17).</p>
      <p>The tolerance parameter of the angular values is optionally checked (dimensional tolerance "yes").</p>

        <b>Note:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The cycle <i>CYCLE995</i> is based on the Renishaw AxiSet<sup> TM</sup> method based on the patent application, WO 2007068912 A1.</p>
      <p>It is recommended to use the Renishaw probe with maximum accuracy for the application of the <code>CYCLE995</code>.</p>
