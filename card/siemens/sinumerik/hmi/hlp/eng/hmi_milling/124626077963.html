        <li>
          <p>Using G0, the starting position for the cycle is approached. In both axes of the current plane, the closest end point of the first elongated hole to be machined is approached at the level of the retraction plane in the tool axis and then lowered to the reference point shifted by the amount of the safety clearance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Each elongated hole is milled in a reciprocating motion. The machining in the plane is performed using G1 and the programmed feedrate. At each reversal point, the infeed to the next machining depth calculated internally in the cycle is performed with G1 and the feedrate, until the final depth is reached.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Retraction to the retraction plane using G0 and approach to the next elongated hole on the shortest path.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After the last elongated hole has been machined, the tool at the position reached last in the machining plane is moved with G0 to the retraction plane, and the cycle terminated.</p>
