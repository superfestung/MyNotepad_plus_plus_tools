      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The tool approaches the starting point in rapid traverse at the height of the retraction plane and goes to the safety clearance. The cycle calculates the starting point.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool first infeeds to the machining depth and then approaches the spigot contour from the side in a quadrant at machining feedrate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The spigot is machined in parallel with the contours from the outside in. The direction is determined by the machining direction (climbing or conventional).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the first plane of the spigot has been machined, the tool retracts from the contour in a quadrant and then infeeds to the next machining depth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The spigot is again approached in a quadrant and machine in parallel with the contours from outside in.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until the programmed spigot depth is reached.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool moves back to the safety clearance in rapid traverse.</p>
        </li>
