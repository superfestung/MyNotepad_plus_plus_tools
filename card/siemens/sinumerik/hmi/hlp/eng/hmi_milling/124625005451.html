      <p>The cycle support is generally upwards compatible. This means that cycle calls in NC programs can always be recompiled with a higher software version, changed and then run again.</p>
      <p>When transferring NC programs to a machine with a lower software version, it cannot be guaranteed, however, that the program will be able to be changed by recompiling cycle calls.</p>
