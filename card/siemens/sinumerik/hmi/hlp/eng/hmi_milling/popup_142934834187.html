<p>After "Swivel plane", the tool orientation is always perpendicular on the machining plane. When milling with radial cutters, it can make technological sense to set the tool at an angle to the normal surface vector. In the swivel cycle, the setting angle is generated by an axis rotation (max. +/- 90 degrees) to the active swivel plane. When setting, the swivel plane is always "additive". With "Approach tool", only rotations are displayed on the swivel cycle input screen form. The user can freely select the rotation sequence.     </p><a id="table_8b7fda18-a930-4f97-8982-462b598bf700" /> <a id="table_0" /> <TableTitle></TableTitle><a id="table_8b7fda18-a930-4f97-8982-462b598bf700" /> <a id="table_0" /> <p><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="table_invisible" border="0"><colgroup><col width="8.4%"></col><col width="91.5%"></col></colgroup><tr valign="top"><td><a id="image_766300299_0" /> <img border="0" src="images/123524983179.png" width="43" height="43"></img> </td><td><p type="p_table_l" style="margin-top: 4px" align="left"><b>Machine manufacturer</b></p><p type="p_table_l" align="left">Please refer to the machine manufacturer's specifications.</p></td></tr></table></p><p></p><a id="image_850952971_0" /> <img border="0" src="images/129254120203.png" width="300" height="280" alt="The length up to the TCP (Tool Center Point) must be entered as tool length of the radial cutter."></img><p class="imgtitle">The length up to the TCP (Tool Center Point) must be entered as tool length of the radial cutter.</p><a name="block_1"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Aligning tools </h3><p>In contrast to "Swivel plane", no rotation is operative in the active frame chain (WCS) in the case of "Swivel tool" or "Align milling tool". Only the offsets calculated by the NC and the corresponding tool orientation are effective. The maximum angle area for "Align milling tool" is limited by the traversing range of the participating rotary axes.</p>
