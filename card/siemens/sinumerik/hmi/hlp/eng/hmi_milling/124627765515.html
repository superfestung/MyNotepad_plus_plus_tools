      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>This measuring method can be used to measure three spheres of equal size, fixed to a common base (workpiece). </p>
      <p>Measuring individual spheres is realized the same as when measuring one sphere, see <a href="124627746699.html">3D sphere (CYCLE997)</a>.</p>
      <p>After measuring the 3rd sphere, for a correction in a work offset (WO), the position of the workpiece on which the spheres are mounted, is corrected as a rotation in the WO.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The position of the center points of the three spheres should be entered as a setpoint in parameters XM1 to ZM3 in the active workpiece coordinate system. The measurement begins with the 1st sphere and ends with the 3rd sphere.</p>
      <p>Positioning between the spheres is realized along a straight line at the height of the starting position of the 1st sphere. The parameter settings – such as the number of measuring points, determining the diameter, diameter – apply to all three spheres.</p>

The sum of the deviations of the spheres to each other must be within the value of parameter TVL.
