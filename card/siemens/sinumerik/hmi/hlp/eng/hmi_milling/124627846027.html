      <p>With the "Measure kinematics completely" measuring variant (<code>CYCLE9960</code>), it is possible to correct the geometric vectors used to define the kinematic 5-axis transformation on the basis of kinematic chains and the tool carrier (in the conventional way via $TC_CARR ) by measuring the positions of the ball in space.</p>
      <p>The measurement is always carried out by means of workpiece probes which sense up to twelve positions of a measuring sphere on each rotary axis. The sphere positions are defined evenly over an area specified by the user so that they correspond to the geometric ratios on the machine. The sphere positions are set automatically solely through the repositioning of the rotary axis that is to be measured in each case. </p>
      <p>For the use of the <code>CYCLE9960</code>, the kinematics must be set up precisely in accordance with the drawing dimensions to be able to guarantee automatic repositioning.</p>
      <p>With <code>CYCLE9960</code>, it is also possible to measure the deviation on the tool tip (TCP) with active transformation for various rotary axis positions, after the measurement and correction of the kinematics. These deviations can be compensated with the "VCS Rotary" compile cycle.</p>
