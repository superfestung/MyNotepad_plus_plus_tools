      <p>Using the "Stock removal residual" function, you can remove material that has remained for stock removal along the contour.</p>
      <p>During stock removal along the contour, the cycle automatically detects any residual material and generates an updated blank contour. For a G code program, for stock removal residual material, "Yes" must be programmed. Material that remains as part of the finishing allowance is not residual material. Using the "Stock removal residual material" function, you can remove unwanted material with a suitable tool.</p>
      <p>The "Stock removal residual material" function is a software option.</p>
