      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>This measuring variant can be used to measure a hole in a workpiece. The hole diameter is measured as well as the hole center point determined. The measurements are always performed parallel to the geometry axis of the active plane.</p>
      <p>With a starting angle, the measuring points can be shifted to the periphery of the hole through rotation around the infeed axis as center point.</p>
      <p>A protection zone can be defined in the hole.</p>
      <p>With the "3D probe with spindle reversal" measuring method, measurement is performed in the axes of the plane as differential measurement. Two complete measurements of the hole are automatically carried out one after the other, one with a spindle position of 180 degrees, and one with 0 degrees. The special procedure for this measurement permits the use of an uncalibrated multi-directional probe. However, the correct tool radius of the probe must be determined once by calibrating the probe. Probe types 712, 713 and 714 are not suitable for this purpose. A positionable spindle is mandatory.</p>
      <p>With the "Align 3D probe" measuring method, the switching direction of the probe is always aligned to the current measuring direction. This function is recommended when high demands are placed on the measuring accuracy. Probe types 712, 713 and 714 are not suitable for this purpose. A positionable spindle is mandatory.</p>
      <p>The measurement result (measurement difference) can be used for the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Correction of a WO so that the workpiece zero is in relation to the center of the hole</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Offset of a tool</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Measurement without offset</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>An extended tool offset in the replacement tools as well as additive and setup offsets are also possible. Empirical values can generally be included in the calculations for tool offsets.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>Two opposite points in each of the two geometry axes of the plane are measured. The hole diameter and the center point are calculated from these four measured actual positions, taking into account the calibration values. From the measuring points of the 1st geometry axis of the plane, the center of this axis is calculated and the probe positioned at this center. Starting from this center point, the two points in the 2nd geometry axis are measured, from which the actual hole diameter is determined. The measurements start in the positive direction of the 1st geometry axis. The measured difference of the hole diameter is used for a tool offset and the position of the hole zero point as basis for a work offset.</p>
      <p>With the selection Setpoint center point "YES", the position of the hole center can be defined as workpiece zero through setpoint specifications.</p>
