      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Deep-hole drilling at the exit from the hole</h3>
      <p>It makes sense to reduce the feedrate when for through drilling the exit is inclined with respect to the tool axis.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Through drilling "no" </p>
          <p>The machining feedrate is used when drilling to the final drilling depth. You then have the option of programming a dwell time at the drilling depth. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Through drilling "yes"</p>
          <p>Up to the remaining drilling depth, you program drilling with the drilling feedrate and, from that point onward, you program drilling with a special feedrate FD.</p>
        </li>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Retraction</h3>
      <p>Retraction can be realized at the pilot hole depth or the retraction plane. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Retraction to the retraction plane is realized with G0 or feedrate, programmable speed as well as direction of rotation respectively stationary spindle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For retraction at the pilot hole depth, subsequent retraction and insertion are performed with the same data. </p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Coolant</h3>
      <p>The technology and tools require that also in the G code, the control for the coolant is supported. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Coolant on</p>
          <p>Switch on at Z0 + safety clearance or at the pilot hole depth (if a pilot hole is being used)</p>

        <li>
          <p>Coolant off</p>
          <p> Always switch off at the final drilling depth</p>

        <li>
          <p>Programming in the G code</p>
          <p>An executable block (M command or subprogram call), which can be programmed as string.</p>
