      <p>During the generation of a multiple clamping program, data from the program header of a source program are transferred to a settings step of the multiple clamping program after every clamping change. The setting of the clamping in the program header is also part of this data. The clamping in the program header designates the name of the rotary axis in which the blank is clamped.</p>
      <p>A distinction is made between the following multiple clamping programs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Program type 1, in which the same program is assigned to several clampings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Program type 2, in which a different program is assigned to each clamping.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A distinction is made between the following systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>System type Α</p>
          <p>All clampings of the multiple clamping are mounted on a table or on a rotary axis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>System type B</p>
          <p> The clampings are distributed over different rotary axes (rotary tables).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Multiple clamping programs of program type 1 cannot be executed on installations of type B and are therefore not permitted.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reason</b>: <br />The program header contains the axis name of one clamping. Since this axis name is entered in each setting step at a clamping change, the assignment to the actual rotary axis of the respective clamping is missing in the generated multiple clamping program.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Example</b>: <br />The installation has two rotary tables C1 and C2. The same blank is clamped on both tables. Both blanks are to be machined with the same program. The rotary table must be addressed for the machining.</p>
      <p>The original program designates clamping C1 in the program header. The resulting multiple clamping program uses the axis name C1 for both rotary tables, because the other axis name is not known to the program.</p>
      <p>The other combinations of multiple clamping programs and installation types are permitted and supported.</p>
