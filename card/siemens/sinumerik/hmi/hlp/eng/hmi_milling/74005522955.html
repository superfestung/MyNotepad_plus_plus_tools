      <p>The alarm and fault thresholds of the additional temperature sensor that are displayed on the user interface as limits, are stored in the SMI24. They are used only for the statistical evaluation of the SMI24. A delay time setting for the violation of the alarm threshold stored in the SMI24 until the fault is triggered is not relevant for the display.</p>
      <p>Please note: The parameter values of p4102[0..1] (alarm/fault threshold) and p4103 (delay time) are predefined and cannot be changed.</p>
      <p>Changing the parameter values of p4102[0..1] (alarm/fault threshold) and p4103 (delay time) has no effect on the values displayed on the user interface.</p>
      <p>The parameter values of p4102[0..1] (alarm/fault threshold) and p4103 (delay time) have an effect on the shutdown response of the spindle. The spindle is shut down when the fault threshold is violated or the alarm threshold is violated and the delay time set in p4103 has expired. These parameters can be adapted accordingly to prevent an unwanted shutdown of the spindle.</p>
      <p>Currently, the delay time is not predefined by the SMI24. The parameter value of p4103 is set to the factory setting (0 s). This means: The timer is deactivated. </p>
