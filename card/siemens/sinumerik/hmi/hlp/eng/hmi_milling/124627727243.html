      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>This measuring variant can be used to determine and correct the angular position of a three-dimensional inclined plane on a workpiece by measuring three points. The angles are in relation to the rotation around the axes of the active plane G17 to G19.</p>
      <p>The same requirements as for the simple angle measurement apply, see measuring variant <a href="124627463947.html">Align edge</a>.</p>
      <p>Additional data is required for the setpoint specification of the 2nd angle. A correction is made in the zero offset in the rotary components (rotation) of the specified work offset (WO).</p>
      <p>The translatory components of the WO remain unchanged, and should be corrected in a subsequent measurement (e.g. set edge, corner).</p>
      <p>After the measurement, at suitable machines where orientation transformation (swiveling, TRAORI) is set up, the probe can be aligned perpendicular on the measuring plane (machining plane).</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The "Align plane" measuring variant is performed according to the 2-angle measurement principle:</p>
      <p>The angular offsets are in the rotary part of the geometry axes for a workpiece with a three-dimensional inclined plane.</p>
