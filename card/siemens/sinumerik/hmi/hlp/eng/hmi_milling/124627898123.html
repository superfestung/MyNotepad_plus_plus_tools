      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>With this measuring version, the outer diameter of cylindrical workpieces can be measured. The diameter and radius programming are supported.</p>
      <p>The measurement result (measurement difference) can be used as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Correction in the work offset (only for measuring without reversal, 1-point measurement)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Offset of a tool</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Measurement without offset</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The measuring cycle determines the actual value of an inner diameter using a 1-point measurement or 2-point measurement symmetrically around the workpiece zero (center of rotation). The 2-point measurement is performed by reversing the spindle through 180 degree of the workpiece or by making measurements above and below the center of rotation.</p>
