      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Tool (T)   </h3>
      <p>Each time a workpiece is machined, you must program a tool. Tools are selected by name, and the selection is integrated in all parameter screen forms of the machining cycles (with the exception of the straight line/circle).</p>
      <p>The tool length offsets become active as soon as the tool is changed.</p>
      <p>Tool selection is modal for the straight line/circle, i.e. if the same tool is used to perform several machining steps occur in succession, you only have to program one tool for the first straight line/circle.</p>
      <a name="block_2">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Cutting edge (D)   </h3>
      <p>In the case of tools with several cutting edges, there is a separate set of individual tool offset data for each edge. For these tools, you must select or specify the number of the cutting edge that you would like to use for machining.</p>

            <h4 class="Blocklabel">Risk of collision</h4>
            <p class="safety">Collisions may occur if you specify the wrong cutting edge number for some tools (e.g. a flat chamfering drill with guide spigot or step drill) and then traverse the tool. Always ensure that you enter the correct cutting edge number.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Tool length compensation</h3>
      <p>Tool length compensation takes effect as soon as the tool is loaded into the spindle. Different tool offsets can be assigned to each tool with multiple cutting edges.</p>
      <p>The tool length compensation of the spindle tool remains active even after the program has been executed (RESET).</p>
      <a name="block_4">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Radius compensation   </h3>
      <p>The tool radius compensation is automatically included in the machining cycles except for path milling. </p>
      <p>For path milling and straight line/circle, you have the option of programming the machining with or without radius compensation. The tool radius compensation is modal for straight lines/circles, i.e. you have to deselect the radius compensation if you want to traverse without radius compensation.</p>

The machining feedrate is entered in mm/min, mm/rev or in mm/tooth. The feedrate for milling cycles is automatically converted when switching from mm/min to mm/rev and vice versa.</p><p>It is only possible to enter the feedrate in mm/tooth during milling; this ensures that each cutting edge of the milling cutter is cutting under the best possible conditions. The feedrate per tooth corresponds to the linear path traversed by the milling cutter when a tooth is engaged.</p><p>With milling cycles, the feedrate for rough cutting is relative to the milling tool center point. This also applies to finish cutting, with the exception of concave curves where the feedrate is relative to the contact point between the tool and workpiece.</p><p>The maximum feedrate is determined via machine data.</p><a name="block_6"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Converting the feedrate (F) for drilling and milling</h3><p>The feedrate entered for drilling cycles is automatically converted when switching from mm/min to mm/rev and vice versa using the selected tool diameter.</p><p>The feedrate entered for milling cycles is automatically converted when switching from mm/Z to mm/min and vice versa using the selected tool diameter.</p><a name="block_7"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Spindle speed (S) / cutting rate (V)   </h3><p>You have the option of either programming the spindle speed (S) or the cutting rate (V).
