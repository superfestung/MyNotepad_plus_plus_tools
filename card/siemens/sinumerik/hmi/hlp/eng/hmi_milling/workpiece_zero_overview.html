      <p>The reference point for programming a workpiece is always the workpiece zero. You can determine the workpiece zero on the following workpiece elements:   </p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring methods</h3>
      <p>You can measure the workpiece zero either manually or automatically.</p>
      <a name="block_2">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Manual measurement     </h3>
      <p>To manually measure the zero point, you need to manually traverse your tool to the workpiece. You can use edge probes, probes, or dial gauges with known radii and lengths. You can also use any other tool of which you know the radius and length.</p>
      <p>The tools used for measuring must not be electronic probes.</p>
      <a name="block_3">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Automatic measurement</h3>
      <p>For automatic measurements, only use the electronic workpiece probe, tool type 710/712. You must first calibrate the electronic workpiece probes.</p>
      <p>In the case of automatic measuring, first position the workpiece probe manually. After starting using the &lt;CYCLE START> key, the workpiece probe is automatically extended to the workpiece with the measuring feedrate. Retraction motion from the measuring point is realized as a function of the setting data with the rapid traverse velocity or a user-specific positioning velocity.</p>
      <a name="block_4">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Logging measurement results</h3>
      <p>After you have completed the measurement, you have the option to output the displayed values to a log. You can define whether the log file that is generated is continually written to for each new measurement, or is overwritten.</p>
      <a name="block_5">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring with rotation</h3>
      <p>Using function "Measuring with rotation" you have the option to measure without prior calibration and without entering a calibration data set to be used.</p>
      <p>To do this, you will need a positionable spindle as well as an electronic 3D workpiece probe. The radius of the probe ball of the electrical probe must be determined once by calibration and entered in the tool data. </p>
      <a name="block_6">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Spindle orientation of the probe in the measuring direction</h3>
      <p>In order to obtain extremely precise measurement results, you have the option to align the electronic 3D probe in the measuring direction to avoid deviations relating to the rotation-symmetric switching characteristics. Orienting the probe is performed by positioning the working spindle into which the probe is clamped.</p>
      <p>To do this, you will need a positionable spindle as well as an electronic 3D workpiece probe.</p>
      <a name="block_7">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Probe in a machining spindle that cannot be positioned or fixed at the machine</h3>
      <p>You also have the option to measure workpieces using electronic probes on machines without an SPOS-capable spindle.</p>
      <p>To do this, you will need a 3D probe (multi probe type 710). This measurement method requires that the measuring task does not require that the spindle is positioned.</p>
