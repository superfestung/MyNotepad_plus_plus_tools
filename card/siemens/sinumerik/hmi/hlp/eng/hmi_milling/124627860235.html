      <p>With this measuring variant, workpiece dimensions can be measured at front edges and from these offsets derived.</p>
      <p>The measurement result, the measurement difference, can be used as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Correction of a zero offset</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Offset of a tool</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Measurement without offset</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The measuring cycle determines the actual value of a measuring point at a front edge of the turned part, relative to the workpiece zero.</p>
      <p>The difference between the actual value (measured value) and a specified setpoint in the 1st axis of the plane is calculated (for G18: Z).</p>
      <p>An extended tool offset in the summed and setup offsets is possible.</p>
      <p>For the tool offset, generally empirical values can be included in the calculation.</p>
