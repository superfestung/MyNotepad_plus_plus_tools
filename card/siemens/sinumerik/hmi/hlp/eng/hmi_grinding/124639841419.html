      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Example</h3>
      <p>Control with 4 channels, where machining is carried out in 2 channels and 2 other channels are used to control the transport of the new workpieces.</p>
      <p>Mode group 1 channel 1 (machining)</p>
      <p>Channel 2 (transport)</p>
      <p>Mode group 2 channel 3 (machining)</p>
      <p>Channel 4 (transport)</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Mode groups (MGs)</h3>
      <p>Technologically-related channels can be combined to form a mode group.</p>
      <p>Axes and spindles of the same mode group can be controlled by one or more channels.</p>
      <p>An operating mode group is in one of "Automatic", "JOG" or "MDI" operating modes, i.e., several channels of an operating mode group can never assume different operating modes.</p>
