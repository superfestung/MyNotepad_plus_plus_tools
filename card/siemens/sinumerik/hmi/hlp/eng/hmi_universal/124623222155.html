      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Shutdown response</h3>
      <p>The alarm and fault thresholds of the motor temperature sensor that are displayed on the user interface as limits, are stored in the SMI24. They are used for the statistical evaluation of the SMI24 and for the shutdown response of the drive. A delay time setting for the violation of the alarm threshold stored in the SMI24 until the fault is triggered is not relevant for the display.</p>
      <p>Please note: The motor parameter values of p0604, p0605 (alarm/fault threshold) and the delay time p0606 are predefined and cannot be changed. </p>
      <p>The delay time in p0606 has no effect on the values displayed on the user interface. This means: When the alarm threshold is violated and the delay time set in p0606 has expired, the "Motor temperature fault" signal does not change the "Last upper limit violation" display value and the "Number of upper limit violations" is not incremented.</p>
      <p>The parameter values of p0604, p0605 (alarm/fault threshold) and p0606 (delay time) have an effect on the shutdown response of the spindle. The spindle is shut down when the fault threshold is violated or the alarm threshold is violated and the delay time set in p0603 has expired.</p>
      <p>Currently, the delay time is not predefined by the SMI24. The parameter value of p0603 is set to the factory setting (240 s).</p>
