      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Safety operating modes</h3>
      <p>The Safety functions of a SINUMERIK ONE are exclusively used in Safety operating mode <b>Drive-based</b>: </p>
      <a name="block_2">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Commissioning mode</h3>
      <p>All of the input fields are deactivated as long as the displayed drive is not in the commissioning mode. This mode is subsequently called the view mode.</p>
      <p>The drive must be in the commissioning mode in order that safety functions of a drive can be commissioned in the "Drive-based" safety operating mode. </p>
      <p>This has the following special feature: The safety-relevant parameters are monitored by the real-time software using an actual checksum. This actual checksum is adapted as soon as a safety-relevant parameter is changed. If the commissioning mode is to be exited, then this actual checksum is compared with a reference checksum. The commissioning mode cannot be exited as long as these checksums differ. The reference checksum must be aligned with the actual checksum. The reference checksum is written using the "Confirm SI data" function; when doing this, the actual checksum is copied over into the reference checksum.</p>
      <p>The general safety parameterization is carried out in the safety settings. Here, the safety functions applicable for the actual drive are also set. </p>
      <p>All additional parameter assignments for the selected drive must then be subsequently made in the individual safety function of the drive. </p>
      <p>The commissioning mode must be activated for the safety settings as well as for the safety functions of a drive if changes to the parameter assignment are necessary. Only a few basic settings can be changed without the commissioning mode being activated. </p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Access protection and user management for SINUMERIK ONE</h3>
      <p>IT systems and data should be protected from unauthorized access (internal/external) using access management. SINUMERIK supports 2 types of access management:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Using access levels</p>
          <p>This basic form of access management is activated as default when the system is supplied.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using SINUMERIK user management</p>
          <p>This optional security function offers extended configuration options for access protection. User management can be manually activated. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To activate and configure user management, at least one user is required, who is formally assigned the "Security Admin machine OEM" role. Within the scope of the user management, the particular user is authorized to carry out the entire configuration of the user management for the machine OEM and also on behalf of the end user. A system integrator defines which user is assigned this administrator role. </p>
      <p>An appropriately authorized administrator configures or coordinates the following settings in the user management. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Assignment of access authorization via roles, user groups and user accounts to systems, services and applications.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Unique identification of every user (e.g. based on a combination of user name and password).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Prompt blocking or deletion of accounts and authorizations when they are no longer required (e.g. when a user leaves the company).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Reset of the password.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Detailed information on user management in SINUMERIK Operate is provided under the "Setting up and using user management" heading of this online help. </p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Two-channel parameterization</h3>
      <p>Safety functions must be parameterized through two channels; this means that there is one parameter each for the 1st and 2nd channels. These two parameters must be identically parameterized. You can find the corresponding parameters in the parameter description of the SINAMICS S120/S150 Parameter Manual. </p>
      <p>The parameters of the first monitoring channel are set in the windows; the parameters of the second monitoring channel are then copied over using the "Copy SI data" function from the first into the second monitoring channel. The checksum must then be realigned, i.e. "Confirm SI data" must be carried out. </p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">HLA support for SINUMERIK ONE</h3>
      <p>The following safety functions are supported for hydraulic linear drives (HLA): </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Torque Off (STO)/Safe Stop 1 (SS1) Basic</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Torque Off (STO) Extended</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Stop 1 (SS1) Extended</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Stop 2 (SS2)/Safe Operating Stop (SOS)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safely-Limited Speed (SLS)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Speed Monitor (SSM)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Acceleration Monitor (SAM)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Direction (SDI)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safely-Limited Position (SLP)/transferring safety-relevant position values (SP)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, the listed safety functions are only supported if the following options have been activated: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Linear axis</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safety Integrated with an encoder</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Close the shutoff valve with power inhibit (power lock) </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Hardware replacement</h3>
      <p>The hardware replacement must be confirmed if, after the safety functions have been commissioned, a hardware component is replaced. Confirmation is required when replacing the following hardware components: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Control Unit</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Motor Module </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sensor Module</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <a name="block_7">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Parameter lists</h3>
      <p>As an alternative to changing parameters using the data window, you can also check or correct parameters using the <a href="147125442315.html">parameter lists</a>. When doing this, you can simultaneously make the settings for both monitoring channels.</p>
