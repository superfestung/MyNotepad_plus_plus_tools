      <p>You can assign SI passwords for axes/drives in this window. Softkey "SI password" is displayed from the "Manufacturer" access level and higher. A new SI password can be assigned for a drive if the communication with the drive (parameter axis) is possible and p0010 = 0 or 95 (drive commissioning = ready or SI commissioning).</p>

      <p>You can set the following parameters:</p>
      <p>All of the axes with the associated drives and all the drives are listed in the table of axes/drives. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>In the "Assign new SI password" column, you can select the drives to be modified. The checkbox is grayed out if a drive does not satisfy the precondition.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The "SI password is already assigned" checkbox of the axes/drives cannot be changed. The checkbox is set for the axes/drives for which an SI password was already assigned.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>You can enter the SI password assigned (32 bit hexadecimal value) for the drive-based SI in the "New password" and "Repeat password" text fields. You can enter any character. Each character entered in the "New password" and "Repeat password" text fields is shown as "*".</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using softkeys "Select all" and "Deselect all", all of the drives are either selected or deselected with the exception of axes/drives for which the checkbox is locked.<br />Softkey "Select all" is locked if there are no axes/drives in the list that can be selected. If no axis/drive is selected, then the "Deselect all" softkey is locked. </p>
