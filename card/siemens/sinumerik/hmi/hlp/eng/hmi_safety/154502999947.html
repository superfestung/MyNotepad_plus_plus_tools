      <p>This page summarizes all available drive-based Safety Integrated functions. A distinction is made between Safety Integrated Basic Functions and Safety Integrated Extended Functions. </p>
      <p>The safety functions listed here conform to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Category 3 according to EN ISO 13849-1</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Performance level (PL) d according to EN ISO 13849-1</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>SIL2 - safety class (Safety Integrity Level) according to IEC 61508 and IEC 61800-5-2</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Safety Integrated Basic Functions</h3>
      <p>Safety Integrated Basic Functions are part of the standard scope of the drive and can be used without an additional license. They are always available. These functions do not require an encoder and/or do not place any special requirements on the encoder used.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Torque Off (STO)</p>
          <p>Safe Torque Off is a safety function in accordance with EN 60204‑1 that prevents the drive from restarting unexpectedly. STO prevents the supply of energy to the motor which can generate a torque and corresponds to Stop Category 0.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Stop 1 (SS1, time controlled)</p>
          <p>Safe Stop 1 is based on the "Safe Torque Off" function. This means that a Category 1 stop in accordance with EN 60204-1 can be implemented.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Brake Control (SBC)</p>
          <p>Safe Brake Control is used to safely control a holding brake.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <a name="block_2">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Safety Integrated Extended Functions </h3>
      <p>These functions require an additional Safety license: Extended Functions require a safety-relevant encoder.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Torque Off (STO)</p>
          <p>Safe Torque Off is a safety function in accordance with EN 60204‑1 that prevents the drive from restarting unexpectedly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Stop 1 (SS1, time and acceleration controlled)</p>
          <p>Safe Stop 1 is based on the "Safe Torque Off" function. This means that a Category 1 stop in accordance with EN 60204-1 can be implemented.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Brake Control (SBC)</p>
          <p>Safe Brake Control is used to safely control a holding brake.<sup> </sup></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Operating Stop (SOS)</p>
          <p>Safe Operating Stop is used to protect against unintentional movements. The drive is in closed-loop control mode and is not disconnected from the energy supply.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Stop 2 (SS2)</p>
          <p>Safe Stop 2 is used to safely brake the motor with a subsequent transition into the "Safe Operating Stop" state (SOS). This means that a Category 2 stop in accordance with EN 60204-1 can be implemented. There are still 2 variants of SS2:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Safe Stop 2E (SS2E) = with external stop</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Safe Stop 2ESR (SS2ESR) = extended stop and retract</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safely-Limited Speed (SLS)</p>
          <p>Safely-Limited Speed ensures that the drive does not exceed a preset speed limit/velocity. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Speed Monitor (SSM)</p>
          <p>Safe Speed Monitor is used for safely identifying when a speed limit is fallen below in both directions of motion, e.g. to identify zero speed. A failsafe output signal is available for further processing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Direction (SDI)</p>
          <p>Safe Direction is used to safely monitor the direction of motion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safely-Limited Position (SLP)</p>
          <p>Safely-Limited Position ensures that a freely definable traversing range is not left.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Position (SP)</p>
          <p>Enables the transmission of safe position values via PROFIsafe telegrams (901 or 902) to the F-PLC.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Cam (SCA)</p>
          <p>Provides a safe output signal for assessing whether the position of the motor shaft is within a specified range.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safely Limited Acceleration (SLA)</p>
          <p>Prevents the motor from exceeding the defined acceleration limit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Acceleration Monitor (SAM)</p>
          <p>Safe monitoring of the braking operation at the OFF3 ramp.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Safe Brake Ramp (SBR)</p>
          <p>Safe monitoring of the brake ramp.</p>
