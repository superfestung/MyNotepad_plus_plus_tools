      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>This measuring variant can be used to measure a right-angled inside or outside corner of a workpiece.</p>
      <p>In addition to the measurement, the position of the corner can be used as workpiece zero in a specified work offset (WO).</p>
      <p>The measurements are performed paraxially to the WCS. The measuring motion parallel to the edge can be adapted with the screen form parameter α0. This angle specification has no effect on the result.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The measuring cycle moves to 3 measuring points and determines the point of intersection of the resulting straight lines and the angle of rotation to the positive 1st axis of the actual plane. </p>
      <p>The intersection/angle of the corner represents its position. These are saved in the OVR[] result parameters as MCS and WCS values. If the determined corner point is used as a workpiece zero, the setpoint value specifications X0, Y0 (e.g. G17) are taken into account in the calculation of the work offset.</p>
