      <p>You can freely select the machining type (roughing, finishing or complete machining - roughing + finishing). During contour roughing, parallel cuts of maximum programmed infeed depth are created. Roughing is performed to the programmed allowance.</p>
      <p>You can also specify a compensation allowance U1 for finishing operations, which allows you to either finish several times (positive allowance) or to shrink the contour (negative allowance). Finishing is performed in the same direction as roughing.</p>
