      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>This measuring variant can be used to measure the inside or outside corner of an unknown workpiece geometry. The measurements are performed paraxially to the WCS. The measuring motion parallel to the edge can be adapted with the screen form parameter α0. This angle specification has no effect on the result.</p>
      <p>After the measurement, the position of the corner can be used as workpiece zero in a specified work offset (WO).</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The measuring cycle traverses to the 4 measuring points (P1 to P4) one after the other and establishes the point of intersection of the resulting straight lines and the angle of rotation to the reference edge of measuring points P1 and P2 to the 1st axis of the plane (X for G17) in the positive direction</p>
      <p>The intersection/angle of the corner represents its position. These are saved in the OVR[] result parameters as MCS and WCS values. If the determined corner point is used as a workpiece zero, the setpoint value specifications X0, Y0 (e.g. G17) are taken into account in the calculation of the work offset.</p>
      <p>The position of points P1 and P2 in relation to each other determines the direction of the 1st axis of the plane of the new coordinate system.</p>
