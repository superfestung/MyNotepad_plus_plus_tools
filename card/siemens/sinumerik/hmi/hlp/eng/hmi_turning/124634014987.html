      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The tool approaches the starting point at rapid traverse at the height of the retraction plane and is fed in to the safety clearance. The cycle calculates the starting point.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool first infeeds to the machining depth and then approaches the spigot contour from the side in a quadrant at machining feedrate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The spigot is machined in parallel with the contours from the outside in. The direction is determined by the machining direction (climb/conventional) (see "Changing program settings").</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the first plane of the spigot has been machined, the tool retracts from the contour in a quadrant and then infeeds to the next machining depth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The spigot is again approached in a quadrant and machine in parallel with the contours from outside in.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until the programmed spigot depth is reached.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool retracts to the safety clearance at rapid traverse.</p>
        </li>
