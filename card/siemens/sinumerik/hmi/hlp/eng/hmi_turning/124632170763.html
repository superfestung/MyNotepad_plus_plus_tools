      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Tool (T)  </h3>
      <p>Each time a workpiece is machined, you must program a tool. Tools are selected by name, and the selection is integrated in all parameter screen forms of the machining cycles (with the exception for straight line/circle).</p>
      <p>The tool length offsets become active as soon as the tool is changed.</p>
      <p>Tool selection is modal for the straight line/circle, i.e. if the same tool is used to perform several machining steps in succession, you only have to program one tool for the first straight line/circle.</p>

      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Cutting edge (D)  </h3>
      <p>In the case of tools with several cutting edges, there is a separate set of individual tool offset data for each edge. For these tools, you must select or specify the number of the cutting edge that you would like to use for machining.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Radius compensation  </h3>
      <p>The tool radius compensation is automatically taken into account during all machining cycles, with the exception of path milling and straight.</p>
      <p>For path milling and straight lines, you have the option of programming the machining with or without radius compensation. The tool radius compensation is modal for straight lines, i.e. you have to deselect the radius compensation again if you want to traverse without radius compensation.</p>

The machining feedrate is entered in mm/min, mm/rev or in mm/tooth. </p><p>It is only possible to enter the feedrate in mm/tooth during milling; this ensures that each cutting edge of the milling cutter is cutting under the best possible conditions. The feedrate per tooth corresponds to the linear path traversed by the milling cutter when a tooth is engaged.</p><p>For milling and turning cycles, the feedrate during roughing is relative to the milling or cutting center point. This is also applies to finishing, with the exception of contours with inner curves. In this case, the feedrate is relative to the contact point between the tool and the workpiece.</p><p>The maximum feedrate is determined via machine data.</p><a id="table_bc6bdece-0c1f-3435-832a-576098645f66"></a> <a id="table_1"></a> <a id="table_bc6bdece-0c1f-3435-832a-576098645f66"></a> <a id="table_1"></a> <p><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="table_invisible" border="0"><colgroup><col width="8.4%"><col width="91.5%"></colgroup><tr valign="top"><td><a id="image_766300299_0"></a> <img border="0" src="images/123524983179.png" width="43" height="43"/> </td><td><p type="p_table_l" style="margin-top: 4px" align="left"><b>Machine manufacturer</b></p><p type="p_table_l" align="left">Please refer to the machine manufacturer's specifications.</p></td></tr></table></p><p></p><a name="block_5"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Converting the feedrate (F) for drilling and milling</h3><p>The feedrate entered for drilling cycles is automatically converted when switching from mm/min to mm/rev and vice versa using the selected tool diameter.</p><p>The feedrate entered for milling cycles is automatically converted when switching from mm/Z to mm/min and vice versa using the selected tool diameter.</p><a name="block_6"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Spindle speed (S)  </h3><p>The spindle speed S specifies the number of spindle revolutions per minute (rpm) and is programmed along with a tool. The speed specified relates to the main spindle (S1) or counter-spindle (S3) when turning and axial drilling, and to the tool spindle (S2) when drilling and milling.</p><p>The spindle starts immediately after the tool change. The spindle stops upon reset, program end, or a tool change. The spindle's direction of rotation is specified in the tool list for each tool.</p><a name="block_7"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Cutting rate (V)  </h3><p>The cutting rate V is a circumferential velocity (m/min) and is programmed together with a tool, as an alternative to the spindle speed. The cutting rate is relative to the main spindle (V1) or the counter-spindle (V3) for turning and axial drilling, and corresponds to the circumferential velocity of the workpiece at the point that is currently being machined.</p><p>However, for drilling and milling, the cutting rate is relative to the tool spindle (V2) and corresponds to the peripheral speed at which the cutting edge of the tool machines the workpiece.</p><a name="block_8"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Converting the spindle speed (S) / cutting rate (V) when milling</h3><p>As an alternative to the cutting rate, you can also program the spindle speed. </p><p>For the milling cycles, the cutting rate (m/min) that is entered is automatically converted into the spindle speed (rpm) using the tool diameter - and vice versa.</p><a name="block_9"></a><h3 class="Blocktitle">Machining  </h3><p>When machining some cycles, you can choose between roughing, finishing, or complete machining.
