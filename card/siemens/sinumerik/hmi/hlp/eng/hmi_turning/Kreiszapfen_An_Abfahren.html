      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The tool approaches the starting point at rapid traverse at the height of the retraction plane and is fed in to the safety clearance. The starting point is always on the positive X axis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool approaches the spigot contour sideways in a semicircle at machining feedrate. The tool first executes infeed at machining depth and then moves in the plane. The spigot is machined depending on the programmed machining direction (up-cut/down-cut) in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the spigot has been traversed once, the tool retracts from the contour in a semicircle and then infeed to the next machining depth is performed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The spigot is approached again in a semicircle and traversed once. This process is repeated until the programmed spigot depth is reached.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool moves back to the safety clearance at rapid traverse.</p>
