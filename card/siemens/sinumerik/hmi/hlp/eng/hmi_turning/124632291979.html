      <p>If you wish to shorten the approach/retraction for a machining cycle or solve a complex geometrical situation when approaching/retracting, you can generate a special cycle. In this case, the approach/retraction strategy normally used is not taken into account.    </p>
      <p>You can insert the approach/retraction cycle between any machining step program blocks, but not within linked program blocks. </p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Starting point</h4>
      <p>The starting point for the approach/retraction cycle is the safety clearance approached after the last machining operation.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Tool change</h4>
      <p>If you want to perform a tool change, you can move the tool through a total of 3 positions (P1 to P3) to the tool change point and through a maximum of 3 additional positions (P4 to P6) to the next starting point. If the tool does not need to be changed, however, you have a total of 6 positions available for the approach to the next starting position.</p>
      <p>If 3 or 6 positions are not sufficient for the approach/retraction, you can call the cycle several times in succession to program further positions.</p>
