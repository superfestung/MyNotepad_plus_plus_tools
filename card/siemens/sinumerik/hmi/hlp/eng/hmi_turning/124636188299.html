      <p>Using a multitool you have the possibility of storing more than one tool at a magazine location. </p>
      <p>The multitool itself has two or more locations to accept tools. The tools are directly mounted on the multitool. The multitool is located at a location in the magazine.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Typical applications</h4>
      <p>One application for using multitools on lathes with revolver and counterspindle is to equip the multitool with two turning tools. One turning tool for machining on the main spindle and one turning tool for machining on the counterspindle.</p>
      <p>An additional application is to use multitools on lathes equipped with a tool spindle. A multitool, on which several tools have been mounted, is inserted in the tool spindle at this machine. A tool change within the multitool is realized by positioning the multitool, i.e. by rotating the tool spindle.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Geometrical arrangement of the tools on the multitool</h4>
      <p>The geometrical arrangement of the tools is defined by the clearance between the locations on the multitool.</p>
      <p>The clearance between the locations can be defined as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Using the multitool location number or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>using the angle of the multitool location</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If angle is selected here, then the value of the angle must be entered for each multitool location.</p>
      <p>Regarding loading and unloading in a magazine, the multitool is treated as a single unit.</p>
