      <p>You must appropriately set the zero point for the 3D model so that the positions of the models match the zero point of the workpiece. For the main spindle and counterspindle, the zero point can be set to machining step "Workpiece".</p>
      <p>Separate zero points can be defined for the main spindle and counterspindle. The main spindle coordinate system is always clockwise. </p>
      <p>For turning machines with counterspindle, you define the transition between main spindle and counterspindle machining separately for inside and outside machining operations.</p>
      <p>If swiveling is set up at your machine, you have the option of defining a dedicated zero point for each plane.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Workpiece zero point position</h3>
      <p>You have the option of defining the zero point of the workpiece using elements of the 3D model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Unchanged</p>
          <p>The selection "unchanged" takes the workpiece zero point from the 3D model. </p>
          <p>If the zero point for the counterspindle is set to "unchanged", then it corresponds to the zero point of the main spindle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Turned part</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Point of intersection, 3 surfaces</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Point of intersection, 2 edges</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>About feature</p>
          <p>The zero point is defined at the center point of the selected model. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Position zero point plane</h3>
      <p>You have the option of defining the zero point of the plane using elements of the 3D model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The same as the workpiece</p>
          <p>With selection "the same as the workpiece", the zero point of the plane remains unchanged, i.e. as defined in the workpiece. <br />This selection is suitable for machining operations performed at the base plane.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Point of intersection, 3 surfaces</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Point of intersection, 2 edges</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>About feature</p>
          <p>The zero point is defined at the center point of the selected model. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Orientation of the coordinate system</h3>
      <p>The Z axis is aligned vertically with respect to a freely selectable surface. The direction of the X axis is defined using an edge. The direction of the X axis can be adapted using parameter "Rotation Z". For instance, the direction of the X axis can be inverted by applying an offset of 180°.</p>
      <a name="block_4">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Point of rotation for swiveling</h3>
      <p>In addition to the zero point of the plane, you define the point of rotation for swiveling. </p>
      <p>The point of rotation does not influence the machining, but is used to provide a better understanding of the values in the "Swivel plane" screen form.</p>
      <p>Here you choose between the following settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The same as the workpiece</p>
          <p>When selecting "the same as workpiece" then the point of rotation corresponds to the workpiece zero point.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Point of intersection, 3 surfaces</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Point of intersection, 2 edges</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> An additional offset of the coordinates can be entered in the parameters XD, YD and ZD.</p>
