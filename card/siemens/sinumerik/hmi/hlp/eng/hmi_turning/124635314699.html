      <h3 class="BlocktitleFirst">Function   </h3>
      <p>This measuring variant can be used to measure a sphere. Measuring can be parallel to the axis or on a circular path in the workpiece coordinate system.</p>
      <p>The center point (position of the sphere) for a known diameter is determined from three or four measuring points at the circumference and one measuring point at the "north pole" of the sphere. With the selection "Determine sphere diameter" and "No repeat measurement", using an additional measurement, the sphere diameter is correctly determined.</p>
      <p>If "Determine sphere diameter" and "With repeat measurement" are selected, the additional measurement is performed in the 1st pass only.</p>
      <p>In the 2nd pass (repeat pass), the diameter is calculated internally without an additional measurement.</p>
      <p>Measuring cycle CYCLE997 can measure the sphere and, in addition, automatically correct a work offset (WO) in the translational offsets of the three axes of the active plane on the basis of the position of the sphere center.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The following description refers to the machining plane G17:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Axes of the plane: XY</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Tool axis: Z</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beginning at the starting position, the setpoint of the sphere equator is approached initially in -X and then in -Z. Three or four points are measured at this measuring height.</p>
