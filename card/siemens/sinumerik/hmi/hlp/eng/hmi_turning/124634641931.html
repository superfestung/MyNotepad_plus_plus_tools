        <b>Only applies on a turning machine without the milling technology.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With this measuring version, a workpiece probe with cutting edge positions SL=5 to 8 can be calibrated on a known surface (workpiece-related). The trigger points of the probe are determined.</p>
      <p>Optionally, the actual length can be entered in the tool offset memory via the "Adapt tool length" parameter.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Measuring principle</h3>
      <p>The switching position of the workpiece probe in an axis is calculated into the measuring probe length. The calculated trigger point is determined in the corresponding axis and axis direction, and entered in the selected calibration data set (calibration data field) of the workpiece probe. </p>
      <p>The probe travels in the measuring direction to the calibration edge (e.g. workpiece)</p>
