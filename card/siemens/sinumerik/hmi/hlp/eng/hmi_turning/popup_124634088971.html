<p>The CYCLE800 swivel cycle is used to swivel to any surface in order to either machine or measure it. In this cycle, the active workpiece zeros and the work offsets are converted to the inclined surface taking into account the kinematic chain of the machine by calling the appropriate NC functions and rotary axes (optionally) are positioned.    </p><p>Swiveling can be realized:</p><ul><li><p>axis-by-axis</p></li><li><p>via solid angle</p></li><li><p>via projection angle</p></li><li><p>directly</p></li></ul><p>Before the rotary axes are positioned, the linear axes can be retracted if desired.</p><p>Swiveling always means three geometry axes.</p><p>In the basic version, the following functions</p><ul><li><p>3 + 2 axes, inclined machining and</p></li><li><p>Toolholder with orientation capability</p></li></ul><p>are available.</p><h4 class="Blocklabel">Setting/aligning tools for a G code program</h4><p>The swivel function also includes the "Setting tool", "Align milling tool" and "Align turning tool" functions.
