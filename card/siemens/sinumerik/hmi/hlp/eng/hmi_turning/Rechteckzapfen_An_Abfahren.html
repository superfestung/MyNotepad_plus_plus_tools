          <p>The tool approaches the starting point at rapid traverse at the height of the retraction plane and is fed in to the safety clearance. The starting point is on the positive X axis rotated through α0.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool approaches the spigot contour sideways in a semicircle at machining feedrate. The tool first traverses to the machining depth and then moves in the plane. The spigot is machined depending on the programmed machining direction (up-cut/down-cut) in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the rectangular spigot has been traversed once, the tool retracts from the contour in a semicircle and then infeed to the next machining depth is performed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The rectangular spigot is approached again in a semicircle and traversed once. This process is repeated until the programmed spigot depth is reached.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The tool retracts to the safety clearance with rapid traverse.</p>
