      <p>To measure the workpiece zero, the workpiece probe must always be located or set perpendicular to the measuring plane (machining plane) (e.g. using "Align plane").</p>
      <p>For the measuring versions "Set edge", "Distance 2 edges", "Rectangular pocket" and "Rectangular spigot", the workpiece must first be aligned parallel to the coordinate system. </p>
      <p>To do this, it may be necessary to perform the measuring process in several steps.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Possible step sequences</h4>
      <p>1. "Align plane" (to align the workpiece probe perpendicular to the plane) </p>
      <p>2. "Align edge" (to align the workpiece parallel to the coordinate system) </p>
      <p>3. "Set edge" or "Distance 2 edges" of "Rectangular pocket" or "Rectangular spigot" to define the workpiece zero. </p>
      <p>- OR - </p>
      <p>1. "Align plane" (to align the workpiece probe perpendicular to the plane) </p>
      <p>2. "Corner" or "2 holes" or "2 spigots", to align the coordinate system parallel to the workpiece and to determine the workpiece zero.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Pre-positioning</h3>
      <p>If you want to preposition a rotary axis before measuring with "Align edge", move the rotary axis so that your workpiece is approximately parallel to the coordinate system.</p>
      <p>Set the relevant rotary axis angle to zero with "Set WO". Measurement with "Align edge" will then correct the value for rotary axis offset or include it in the coordinate rotation and align the workpiece edge precisely.</p>
      <p>If you want to preposition your workpiece with "Align plane" prior to measurement, you can set the required angular values under "Manual swivel". With "Set zero plane" you  transfer the resulting rotations into the active work offset.</p>
      <p>The measurement with "Align plane" will then correct the value for the coordinate rotations and precisely align the workpiece.</p>
      <p>If the function "Swivel Manual" is set up on your machine, we recommend that you perform swivel to zero before starting measurement. In that way, you will ensure that the rotary axis positions match the actual coordinate system. </p>
