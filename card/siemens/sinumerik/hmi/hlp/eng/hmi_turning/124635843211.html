      <p>With multi-channel lathes, you have the option of simultaneously machining with 2 channels (4 axes).</p>
      <p>The tools are located in front of and behind the center of rotation, and machine the same workpiece. For sufficiently long cuts, these are simultaneously used at different depth infeeds, with a specified offset.</p>
      <p>The advantage is that you reduce your production time. Further, when machining, the cutting forces are better distributed.      </p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Technological function</h3>
      <p>2-channel machining is available for the "Parallel stock removal" technology.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Leading channel/following channel</h3>
      <p>Define the leading channel when programming workpieces that you wish to machine utilizing multiple channels. As a consequence, you define the channel-specific machine and setting data that are used to create the stock removal programs.</p>
      <p>Turning always starts in the leading channel. The second channel, also known as the following channel, starts with the second depth infeed as soon as the leading channel has removed stock by a specified "stock removal distance" (offset). If cuts are obtained that are shorter than this offset, then machining is only carried out in the leading channel.</p>
      <a name="block_3">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Offset</h3>
      <p>If the offset is not equal to zero, then a dedicated stock removal program is generated for each channel. Automatically generated WAIT commands are used to synchronize both programs.</p>
      <p>If the offset is equal to zero, then only one stock removal program is generated. This program is started in the leading channel. Axis coupling is used to generate the motion of the following channel.</p>
      <p>For multi-channel lathes, the name of the generated stock removal program is extended by identifier "_C" with a subsequent two-digit channel number.</p>

      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Roughing</h3>
      <p>When roughing, typically there is an offset between the channels when machining (channel offset DCH).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>When the parameter is positive, then the leading channel machining is executed before the following channel by the channel offset.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the parameter is negative, then the machining sequence is interchanged. The program generated for the leading channel is in this case, started in the following channel.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the parameter is equal to zero, then the workpiece is machined without offset (refer to the paragraph "Finishing balance cutting").</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Finishing</h3>
      <p>2-channel finish cutting is only possible with Balance Cutting.</p>
      <p>Only one machining program is generated for the leading channel, and this is executed there. The motion in the following channel is coupled to this motion.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Balance Cutting</h4>
      <p>Balance Cutting involves symmetrical machining in both channels. In so doing, the cutting forces are evenly distributed between both sides of the workpiece. The tools are opposite one another at the same infeed depth.</p>
