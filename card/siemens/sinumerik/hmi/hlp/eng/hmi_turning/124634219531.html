      <p>If you require the same machining steps when programming different workpieces, you can define these machining steps in a separate subprogram. You can then call this subprogram in any program.</p>
      <p>Identical machining steps therefore only have to be programmed once.</p>
      <p>A distinction is not made between the main program and subprograms. This means that you can call a "standard" ShopTurn program or G code program in another ShopTurn program as a subprogram.</p>
      <p>You can also call another subprogram in the subprogram. The maximum nesting depth is 15 subprograms.</p>

      <p>If you want to call a ShopTurn program as a subprogram, the program must already have been calculated once (load or simulate program in the "Machine Auto" mode). This is not necessary for G code subprograms.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Program clipboard</h4>
      <p>If you use the "Execution from external storage (EES)" software option, the subprogram can be stored locally or externally in an arbitrary program memory configured for EES.</p>
      <p>If you use the "CNC user memory extended" software option, the subprogram can be stored on the system memory card in a program memory configured for EES.</p>
      <p>Without these two software options, the subprogram must always be stored in the NCK work memory (in a separate "XYZ" directory or in the "Subprograms" directory). If you still want to call a subprogram located on another drive, you can use G code command "EXTCALL".</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Program header</h4>
      <p>Please note that when a subprogram is called, the settings in the program header of the subprogram are evaluated. These settings also remain active even after the subprogram has been exited.</p>
      <p>If you wish to activate the settings from the program header of the main program again, you can make the settings again in the main program after calling the subprogram. </p>
