      <p>To check the loads on the spindle, the speed and the torque are recorded in a histogram as a function of the operating hours. The color coding indicates the following states: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Light green: low load</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Green: rated load</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Yellow: high load</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Orange: critical load</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The heights of the individual bars correspond to the percentage time shares (dwell time) in relation to the operating hours under speed. The accumulated number of operating hours under speed for the spindle are shown above or below the respective bar for the corresponding speed or torque range. The width of the bar corresponds to the evaluated speed or torque range.</p>

        <b>Possible conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The speed histogram is an indication of the load on the bearings and rotary gland caused by the speed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The speed histogram is an indication of the load on the bearings caused by the stock removal forces. The relationship between torque and radial force changes depending on the tool diameter (lever arm), the milling arc (superimposition of the cutting forces of the individual cutting edges) and the cutting force coefficients (the stock removal force consists of cutting force, feedrate force and passive force - only the cutting force is acquired via the torque).</p>
