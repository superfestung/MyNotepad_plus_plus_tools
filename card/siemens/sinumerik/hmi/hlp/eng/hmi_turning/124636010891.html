      <p>With SINUMERIK Operate, you can work at a lathe with two tool holders, both of which are mounted on an X axis. The tool holders may be revolvers, multifix, or a combination of both.</p>
      <p>The main machining is performed in the negative X axis direction. As both tool holders are mounted on the same axis it is only possible to machine with one tool.</p>
      <p>The workpiece is always located between the two tool holders. The tool lengths of all tools, i.e. of both tool holders, have the same reference point, which is usually on tool holder 1. That is why the tool lengths of the tools of the second tool holder are always longer than those of the tools on the first tool holder.</p>
