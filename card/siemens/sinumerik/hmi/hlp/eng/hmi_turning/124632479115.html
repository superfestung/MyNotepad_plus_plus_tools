      <h3 class="Blocktitle">DF (degression amount/percentage)</h3>
      <p>For deep holes that are drilled in several steps, it makes sense to work with decreasing values for the individual drilling strokes (degression). This allows for removal of the chips and there is no tool breakage. In the parameter, either program an incremental degression value in order to reduce the first drilling depth step by step or a % value to act as a degression factor.</p>
      <a name="block_4">

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">DF as degression value</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>In the first step, the depth parameterized with the first drilling depth D is traversed as long as it does not exceed the total drilling depth.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>From the second drilling depth on, the drilling stroke is obtained by subtracting the amount of degression from the stroke of the last drilling depth, provided that the latter is greater than the programmed amount of degression. If a value smaller than the programmed amount of degression has already been obtained for the second drilling stroke, this is executed in one cut.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The next drilling strokes correspond to the amount of degression, as long as the remaining depth is greater than twice the amount of degression. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The last two drilling strokes are divided and traversed equally and are therefore always greater than half of the amount of degression. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the value for the first drilling depth is incompatible with the total depth, the error message 61107 "First drilling depth defined incorrectly" is output and the cycle is not executed.</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">DF as percentage</h3>
      <p>The current depth is derived in the cycle as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>In the first step, the depth parameterized with the first drilling depth D is traversed as long as it does not exceed the total drilling depth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The next drilling strokes are calculated from the last drilling stroke multiplied by the degression factor, as long as the stroke does not fall below the minimum drilling depth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The last two drilling strokes are divided equally and traversed and are, therefore, always greater than half of the minimum drilling depth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the value for the first drilling depth is incompatible with the total depth, the error message 61107 "First drilling depth defined incorrectly" is output and the cycle is not executed.</p>
        </li>
