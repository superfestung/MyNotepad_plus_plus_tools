      <p>The "Cut-off" cycle is used when you want to cut off dynamically balanced parts (e.g. screws, bolts, or pipes).</p>
      <p>You can program a chamfer or rounding on the edge of the machined part. You can machine at a constant cutting rate V or speed S up to a depth X1, from which point the workpiece is machined at a constant speed. As of depth X1, you can also program a reduced feedrate FR or a reduced speed SR, in order to adapt the velocity to the smaller diameter.</p>
      <p>Use parameter X2 to enter the final depth that you wish to reach with the cut-off. With pipes, for example, you do not need to cut-off until you reach the center; cutting off slightly more than the wall thickness of the pipe is sufficient.</p>
