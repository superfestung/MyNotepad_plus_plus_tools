      <p>No special entries are required for face machining and peripheral surface machining.    </p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Face machining</h4>
      <p>Milling at the face (G17) is realized on the main spindle in the B axis position B = 0°. If you are machining at the face (G17) of the counterspindle, then this corresponds to the opposite setting of the B axis position B = 180°.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Peripheral surface machining</h4>
      <p>Milling on the peripheral surface is always realized in the B axis position, B = 90° (main and counterspindle).</p>

      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Machining on an inclined surface</h3>
      <p>You can define inclined surfaces in a swivel mask. </p>
      <p>You can enter the rotation of the planes around the geometry axes (X, Y, Z) of the tool coordinate system as described in the workpiece drawing. The rotation of the Work in the program is then automatically converted to a rotation for the relevant B and C axis of the machine during machining.</p>
      <p>The swivel axes are always rotated to place the tool axis perpendicular to the machining axis for machining. During machining, the rotary axes are stationary.</p>
      <p>The coordinate system is adapted to the surface to be machined irrespective of the required rotary axis positions.</p>
