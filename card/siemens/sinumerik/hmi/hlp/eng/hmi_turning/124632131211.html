      <p>A workpiece can be machined on different planes. Two coordinate axes define a machining plane. On lathes with X, Z, and C axes, three planes are available:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Turning</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Face</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Peripheral surface</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Machining planes, face and peripheral surface</h4>
      <p>The face and peripheral machining planes require the CNC-ISO functions "Face surface machining" (Transmit) and "Cylindrical peripheral transformation" (Tracyl) to be set up.</p>
      <p>These functions are a software option.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Additional Y axis</h4>
      <p>For lathes with an additional Y axis, the machining planes are expanded to include two more planes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Face Y</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Peripheral surface Y</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Therefore, the face and peripheral planes are called Face C and Peripheral C.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Inclined axis</h4>
      <p>If the Y axis is an inclined (oblique) axis (i.e. the axis is not perpendicular to the others), you can also select the "Face Y" and "Peripheral Y" machining planes and program the traversing movements in Cartesian coordinates. The control system then automatically transforms the programmed traversing movements of the Cartesian coordinate system into the traversing movements of the inclined (oblique) axis.</p>
      <p>The CNC-ISO function "Oblique Axis" (Traang) is required for the purpose of transforming the programmed traversing movements.</p>
      <p>This function is a software option.</p>
      <h4 class="Blocklabel">Selecting the machining plane</h4>
      <p>The machining plane selection is integrated into the parameter screen forms of the individual drilling and milling cycles. For turning cycles and for "axial drilling" and "axial threads", the turning plane is automatically selected. For the "straight" and "circle" functions, you must specify the machining plane separately.</p>
      <p>The settings for the machining plane always act modally, i.e. until you select another plane.</p>
      <p>The machining planes are defined as follows:</p>
      <a name="block_1">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Turning</h3>
      <p>The turning machining plane corresponds to the X/Z plane (G18).</p>
      <a name="block_2">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Face/Face C</h3>
      <p>The Face/Face C machining plane corresponds to the X/Y plane (G17). For machines without a Y axis, however, the tools can only move in the X/Z plane. The X/Y coordinates that have been entered are automatically transformed into a movement in the X and C axis.</p>
      <p>You can use face surface machining with a C axis for drilling and milling if, for instance, you want to mill a pocket on the face surface. You can choose between the forward or rear face surface for this purpose.</p>
      <a name="block_3">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Peripheral surface/Peripheral C</h3>
      <p>The Peripheral/Peripheral C machining plane corresponds to the Y/Z plane (G19). For machines without a Y axis, however, the tools can only move in the Z/X plane. The Y/Z coordinates that you entered are automatically transformed into a movement in the C and Z axes.</p>
      <p>You can use peripheral surface machining with a C axis for drilling and milling if, for instance, you want to mill a slot with constant depth on the peripheral surface. You can choose between the inner or outer surface for this purpose.</p>
      <a name="block_4">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Face Y</h3>
      <p>The face Y machining plane corresponds to the X/Y plane (G17). You can use the face surface machining with a Y axis for drilling and milling if, for instance, you want to mill a pocket on the face surface. You can choose between the forward or rear face surface for this purpose.</p>
      <p>With parameter CP, you can define the position of the face surface before machining. CP does not influence the machining position with respect to the workpiece. The parameter only serves to position the workpiece with rotary axis C, so that the workpiece can be machined on the machine. This is required for machines where the traversing path is restricted in the X axis.</p>
      <a name="block_5">
      </a>
      <h3 class="Blocktitle">Peripheral surface Y</h3>
      <p>The peripheral Y machining plane corresponds to the Y/Z plane (G19). You can use peripheral surface machining with a Y axis for drilling and milling if, for instance, you want to mill a pocket with a flat base on the peripheral surface or drill holes that do not point to the center. You can choose between the inner or outer surface for this purpose.</p>
      <p>Using parameter C0, you can define the position of the surface to be machined with respect to the workpiece itself. Before machining, the workpiece is appropriately positioned using rotary C.</p>
