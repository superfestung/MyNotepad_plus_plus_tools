          <p>The tool first moves to the starting point calculated internally in the cycle at rapid traverse.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The first cut is made at the machining feedrate, starting from the flank and traveling along the shape of the thread undercut as far as the safety distance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool moves to the next starting position at rapid traverse.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the thread undercut is finished.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The tool moves back to the starting point at rapid traverse.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>During finishing, the tool travels as far as cross-feed VX.</p>
